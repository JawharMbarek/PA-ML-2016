225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
100_ 19	neutral	It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
3_ 27	positive	If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
242_ 44	neutral	The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
107_ 14	positive	Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
97_ 4	neutral	Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
242_ 17	neutral	As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
189_ 37	neutral	Click on ""Zen Micro Media Explorer"" and then click on ""Transfer Data Between PC and Device"" after that, a File Explorer window opens.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a ""customer priority ID number.""
178_ 12	neutral	I call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
132_ 28	neutral	I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
205_ 7	positive	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
173_ 3	negative	Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!""
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
114_ 1	positive	I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
79_ 2	neutral	I can honestly speak to its worth!
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
49_ 1	neutral	I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
0_ 108	neutral	But believe me, it's well worth it.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
32_ 18	neutral	I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
187_ 8	neutral	The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
132_ 488	neutral	 You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
52_ 1	neutral	Can't complain at all!
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
132_ 49	neutral	iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
220_ 18	positive	eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
208_ 9	negative	The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
0_ 109	positive	Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
166_ 66	neutral	It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
190_ 15	negative	Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
133_ 3	positive	It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
222_ 8	neutral	Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
233_ 28	positive	It has great upgradibility.
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
0_ 195	neutral	I use ""get ready"" and ""here it comes"".
83_ 6	positive	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
58_ 0	neutral	My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
78_ 3	negative	But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
132_ 20	negative	 FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
0_ 16	positive	This camera is truely superb.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
132_ 115	neutral	It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
112_ 9	negative	If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a ""foreign"" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
200_ 1	negative	The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
140_ 16	neutral	As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to ""hip"" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the ""awkward"" factor.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
186_ 9	positive	The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the ""click"" sound to get this much life out of it.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
290_ 11	neutral	An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
93_ 8	positive	It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but ""Internet Security"" just isn't worth it.
105_ 1	positive	But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
112_ 2	neutral	This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
119_ 3	positive	This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
281_ 8	positive	NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
287_ 37	negative	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
0_ 206	neutral	I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
189_ 43	neutral	**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
132_ 340	negative	Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
220_ 8	positive	I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
114_ 6	neutral	I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a ""dock station"" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
255_ 10	positive	I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 388	neutral	 I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
86_ 2	negative	The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 321	neutral	When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
71_ 6	neutral	If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.
89_ 9	neutral	I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.
8_ 1	positive	The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
73_ 6	positive	*holds the odor in nicely!
18_ 0	positive	I love this camera!
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
1_ 7	positive	I'd say that this camera is perfect.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
293_ 0	neutral	Okay, how can I say this nicely?
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
132_ 287	neutral	 I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
258_ 2	neutral	I have ordered 2 ""cell phone + service""s from Amazon.
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
220_ 5	positive	No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
169_ 7	neutral	Nor did I need any settings from my ISP.
55_ 4	negative	In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
132_ 419	neutral	 I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
132_ 195	neutral	  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.
132_ 159	neutral	Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
13_ 2	negative	All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
111_ 2	neutral	Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
147_ 1	positive	It is a nice router in all ways but one.
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
298_ 32	positive	Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...."" My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
3_ 3	positive	it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
155_ 3	neutral	I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.
298_ 26	neutral	We'd have probably tried McAffee, but I hear from reviews that it has troubles too.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
211_ 14	neutral	Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
221_ 21	positive	The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
231_ 7	positive	If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
129_ 11	positive	For the price I don't think you can beat it.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
188_ 9	positive	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
132_ 268	neutral	They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, ""test drive"", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
201_ 4	positive	Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
223_ 16	neutral	Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
132_ 165	negative	 The user support service isn't too great either.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
100_ 26	neutral	At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.
190_ 13	negative	 Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
207_ 30	neutral	Amazing.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
189_ 6	neutral	First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck?
299_ 9	negative	Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
175_ 8	positive	The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
70_ 6	positive	Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
15_ 16	positive	The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
102_ 2	neutral	I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
132_ 138	neutral	  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
304_ 1	negative	The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.
189_ 21	neutral	You can buy a new battery for 49.99.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
108_ 3	positive	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
186_ 17	positive	For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
3_ 4	positive	There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.

197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.

268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
178_ 3	neutral	As I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
0_ 183	positive	overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.

136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
36_ 11	positive	Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.

224_ 2	negative	Within one month, my player completely died.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
110_ 17	neutral	I think I'll go rout something...
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.

183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for ""abusing"" your ipod.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
132_ 12	negative	Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
150_ 1	positive	However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
166_ 6	neutral	) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
319_ 11	negative	However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the ""Speedboost"" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
132_ 132	neutral	 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
132_ 317	neutral	Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.
225_ 27	negative	The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
193_ 53	neutral	Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the ""User Guide"" tab which loads the manual.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
179_ 14	positive	Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
313_ 3	neutral	I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
181_ 2	negative	After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
251_ 10	neutral	A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .
132_ 218	neutral	No big deal.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool ""halo"" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
54_ 0	neutral	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
115_ 8	negative	If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
282_ 0	negative	As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
166_ 5	neutral	What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
175_ 3	neutral	Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
206_ 23	neutral	Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got ""Windows Virtual Memory Low"" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
122_ 1	negative	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
268_ 19	negative	Sometimes, various applications crash.
14_ 1	positive	I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
99_ 10	neutral	Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
256_ 6	negative	The ""movies"" last about 5 seconds.
0_ 94	neutral	i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
261_ 0	positive	I highly recommend this phone.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
176_ 2	positive	A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
135_ 12	negative	The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
132_ 463	neutral	The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.
158_ 0	positive	I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
53_ 0	positive	So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
217_ 23	positive	If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.
222_ 5	positive	I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
84_ 2	positive	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
5_ 5	negative	1) It is perhaps too small.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
145_ 1	positive	So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
205_ 4	neutral	Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that ""fuzzy legal feeling"" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
147_ 7	neutral	You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
255_ 1	positive	Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
193_ 47	positive	In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper ""disappears"".
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
132_ 280	neutral	 This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.
191_ 7	neutral	I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
76_ 4	neutral	OK.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
132_ 215	neutral	Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
137_ 3	positive	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
223_ 10	neutral	The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
304_ 4	negative	I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
1_ 5	negative	A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
133_ 6	positive	There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
191_ 28	neutral	For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
279_ 4	positive	It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
127_ 8	neutral	It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).
233_ 29	neutral	I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.

106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.

132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
299_ 3	neutral	After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
250_ 10	neutral	All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select ""calling card call"".
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
240_ 3	positive	It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
132_ 156	neutral	 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, ""the wireless connection"".
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
129_ 3	negative	It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
107_ 10	neutral	I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.
169_ 2	neutral	To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
131_ 2	negative	My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
199_ 11	positive	However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro.
60_ 3	neutral	ANY Garbage bags will fit.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the ""playforsure"" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
169_ 10	neutral	to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better.
234_ 1	neutral	Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
144_ 5	neutral	This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with ""MAC settings"", etc.
274_ 5	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
100_ 16	neutral	Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
242_ 9	neutral	On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
68_ 1	neutral	I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
214_ 13	positive	It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the ""Speedbooster"" version.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
189_ 2	neutral	Bottom line.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
73_ 7	positive	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
224_ 7	neutral	I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
100_ 22	negative	To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
139_ 24	neutral	They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
183_ 17	neutral	2.
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
220_ 13	neutral	Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows… maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
267_ 6	positive	6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
183_ 38	neutral	) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
175_ 1	positive	For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
132_ 333	negative	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.
244_ 1	negative	The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
183_ 14	neutral	1.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
208_ 17	positive	The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
79_ 3	positive	I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
28_ 4	neutral	No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
132_ 299	neutral	This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
189_ 40	neutral	So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
227_ 2	negative	To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC.
66_ 4	positive	I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
243_ 23	neutral	He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
132_ 312	neutral	It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
99_ 9	positive	We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
3_ 16	negative	The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
0_ 68	negative	Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
243_ 17	neutral	Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.

132_ 8	positive	The bass is deep and the treble is clear.

65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit ""play,"" so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
306_ 2	neutral	In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a ""ball park"" measure.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of ""nice to have"" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
113_ 3	positive	I have only used it with the 1/4"" collet and a 1/2"" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
205_ 0	positive	I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
178_ 19	positive	Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly.
225_ 29	neutral	A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
251_ 15	negative	I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
89_ 18	neutral	Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!
79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
59_ 1	negative	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
213_ 7	neutral	included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
294_ 0	neutral	Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name.
209_ 12	neutral	Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
312_ 10	negative	I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.

134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
253_ 6	positive	The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
58_ 10	neutral	We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
132_ 454	neutral	   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
240_ 7	negative	Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
21_ 1	neutral	The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
132_ 336	positive	 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
0_ 38	positive	Good image quality.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
214_ 5	neutral	I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
65_ 7	neutral	unlike the Diaper Genie!
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
140_ 14	neutral	I followed the prompts to disconnect and reconnect Ethernet cables, and then rebooted.
135_ 18	negative	What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
136_ 3	neutral	Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.
0_ 69	neutral	But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
132_ 170	neutral	At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
211_ 9	positive	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
242_ 10	neutral	Me likes.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
127_ 5	negative	I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my ""jukebox"" needed to be purged.
132_ 5	positive	SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
138_ 8	neutral	But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
124_ 0	neutral	I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
228_ 7	neutral	Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
183_ 2	negative	This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
193_ 41	neutral	Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
32_ 12	neutral	I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
135_ 6	neutral	But wh!
142_ 13	neutral	  !
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
221_ 13	neutral	(Like I really wanted ""Hotel California"" anyway.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
190_ 10	neutral	Too bad.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
140_ 15	neutral	Problem solved.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
192_ 14	negative	I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
100_ 20	negative	Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
189_ 39	neutral	It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that ""Can be delayed further"".
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
228_ 6	positive	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
49_ 2	positive	All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
189_ 27	neutral	4.
89_ 12	negative	2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
13_ 0	negative	I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
143_ 0	neutral	I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
185_ 5	positive	Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the ""hold"" switch.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
157_ 0	positive	This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.
132_ 360	neutral	 I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
154_ 9	positive	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
0_ 40	neutral	Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
209_ 25	neutral	Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.
132_ 468	neutral	 I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
280_ 4	negative	I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
243_ 18	neutral	This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.
287_ 0	neutral	I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.
188_ 8	neutral	and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
132_ 339	neutral	   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
283_ 1	positive	Anti-Spam is Good
306_ 7	negative	Booting up my computer took forever!!!
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
298_ 22	positive	We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
226_ 1	neutral	In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
0_ 138	neutral	I Was wrong.
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
208_ 12	negative	is not as intuitive as I would like.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
209_ 6	neutral	Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2"" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
0_ 160	positive	However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
72_ 3	positive	No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
170_ 17	positive	Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
189_ 16	neutral	2.
306_ 13	negative	After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a ""Normal"" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
207_ 13	positive	This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
132_ 261	neutral	 It ""feels"" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
129_ 4	negative	Recenly the variable speed control went out.
91_ 6	neutral	That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
214_ 24	positive	I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
153_ 3	neutral	Therefore, if you have a really robust connection (like a T3), this will help.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
243_ 3	neutral	It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
145_ 2	neutral	My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range.
23_ 4	positive	The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
276_ 5	negative	and the battery life is bad !
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
132_ 501	neutral	 It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
190_ 12	negative	One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
68_ 8	positive	And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
131_ 6	positive	When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
212_ 0	neutral	Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
281_ 5	negative	The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
0_ 228	negative	The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
139_ 17	neutral	Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
132_ 6	neutral	 The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
40_ 3	neutral	If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than ""the other"" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
83_ 2	positive	It is mindless to operate.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
174_ 3	neutral	This is universal across every brand I've worked with.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
184_ 1	neutral	  Why?
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
193_ 15	neutral	Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special ""diaper"" trash bags necessary.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
322_ 4	negative	It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is ""buggy"" would be the world's most profound understatement.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
115_ 0	positive	I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
256_ 11	neutral	This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
132_ 143	neutral	when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!
282_ 1	neutral	Here's why:
166_ 72	neutral	It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
193_ 40	positive	I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
310_ 1	neutral	It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.
132_ 214	neutral	 Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)
0_ 200	positive	Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
230_ 2	positive	When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
201_ 12	neutral	In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
0_ 102	positive	they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not ""whine"" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
92_ 4	neutral	That would be my only complaint.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
195_ 32	positive	Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful.
107_ 5	neutral	I used this router to plow out 3"" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to ""unhold"" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
311_ 5	negative	Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
172_ 1	positive	In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
15_ 4	neutral	A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
314_ 3	negative	Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
150_ 7	negative	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
67_ 6	negative	(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
227_ 9	negative	This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
217_ 20	positive	Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
47_ 2	neutral	I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
116_ 7	neutral	The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
60_ 5	positive	This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
233_ 31	positive	The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
250_ 11	neutral	2) Low volume on regular answering.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
132_ 425	negative	 However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
190_ 18	neutral	I also experimented with an adapter for the car.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is ""Run CD first"".
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
88_ 8	positive	Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
0_ 86	positive	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for ""Internet Security 2004"".
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
324_ 7	negative	But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
108_ 6	positive	It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
132_ 361	neutral	As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.
188_ 5	neutral	i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.
132_ 162	negative	  * You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
186_ 4	neutral	I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
304_ 2	neutral	I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.
174_ 0	negative	(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging.
268_ 26	negative	The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
154_ 7	neutral	running the installation wizard again.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a ""vanilla"" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the ""Add to Cart"" button already!
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
324_ 2	negative	Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
310_ 0	neutral	This is a very full featured product.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the ""stuff"" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
183_ 34	positive	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup.
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
223_ 5	neutral	I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
132_ 522	neutral	 Yep, the iPod.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
146_ 2	neutral	The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
32_ 16	neutral	Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
0_ 165	neutral	Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
142_ 9	neutral	Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
195_ 27	positive	The bass treble the sound detail is awsome.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
131_ 10	neutral	I use these routers under a table.
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
243_ 15	neutral	This helps prevent people from sending short ""obscene"" messages to your phone.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
227_ 0	positive	This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an ""extended warranty"" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
132_ 423	positive	 The player is great.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
188_ 1	neutral	i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a ""lock"" function like cell phones to prevent this.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
225_ 64	neutral	So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music.
198_ 7	negative	The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
178_ 20	neutral	I was able to use t!
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
267_ 4	positive	4. Play N-Gage games on it.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
289_ 2	negative	So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
195_ 38	neutral	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2"" shank, 1/2"" diameter, 1"" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4"" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a ""13 mm"" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
181_ 0	neutral	The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
249_ 6	neutral	Go see for yourself.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
3_ 23	positive	The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the ""services"" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec ""service,"" then ran uninstall again.
163_ 7	neutral	If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.
189_ 4	neutral	For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
132_ 245	positive	  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
31_ 7	neutral	If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
132_ 498	positive	The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
0_ 168	positive	Very good ""every day"" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
201_ 29	positive	Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
186_ 12	negative	The touch pad does take a little getting used to.
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of ""brick."" *
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
193_ 9	neutral	The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.
288_ 1	negative	There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
110_ 9	neutral	Why do people spend all that money on accessories to ""raise and lower "" the router in a table??? A waste of money.
132_ 21	negative	There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
320_ 4	neutral	In ""Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
78_ 1	positive	First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
117_ 6	neutral	I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to ""handle"" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
160_ 0	positive	I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a ""free"" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the ""automatic updates"" ran.
118_ 2	neutral	I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
251_ 4	neutral	I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .
299_ 5	neutral	When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the ""sliding wrench"" which comes on the router.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
0_ 151	positive	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
133_ 8	neutral	apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
305_ 2	positive	Seems to work great.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
251_ 1	neutral	My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
221_ 29	positive	Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate.
225_ 45	negative	because the ""engineers"" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
220_ 19	negative	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.
194_ 8	positive	They're easy to use.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
209_ 23	neutral	Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).
182_ 0	neutral	Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not?
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
259_ 3	negative	If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.
201_ 34	negative	- Radio Quality: weak reception
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
123_ 2	negative	The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
257_ 1	positive	With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
31_ 11	neutral	Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
132_ 275	neutral	Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod ""hard drive"" to a new letter.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more ""average"" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
311_ 9	negative	After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
89_ 4	positive	I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
242_ 46	neutral	If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
140_ 13	neutral	ite:  www.linksys.com/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
166_ 56	neutral	speed of a wired connection.
195_ 29	positive	Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool.
0_ 209	neutral	Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
162_ 2	neutral	The PC card setup was painless as well.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
201_ 15	neutral	The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
79_ 8	positive	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
0_ 76	neutral	Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
242_ 21	positive	Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
139_ 5	neutral	That aside, this is not that bad of a product.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
153_ 1	neutral	However, your PC cards should also be Linksys ""g"" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some ""b"" cards.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
143_ 6	neutral	I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
320_ 3	neutral	I used ""Add/Remove Programs"" to unistall NIS 2003.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
179_ 17	neutral	If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
243_ 34	neutral	I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
199_ 0	neutral	After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
183_ 29	neutral	3.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
83_ 5	positive	And it is very easy to clean.
132_ 530	positive	I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, ""I WANT THAT ONE!"" I was willing to shell out
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
196_ 5	positive	By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
217_ 22	positive	The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
140_ 7	neutral	That didn't work either.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
183_ 36	positive	Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
31_ 4	neutral	I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
242_ 1	neutral	For example, the memory card is under the battery.
132_ 286	neutral	 The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an ""800"" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
215_ 11	positive	Its also smaller, and gets more looks.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
97_ 5	negative	Also much less stinky.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
243_ 14	neutral	With the recent ""bluejacking"" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
136_ 5	neutral	Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
58_ 4	neutral	2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
28_ 2	neutral	While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
132_ 234	neutral	Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 ""adjust levels"" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
117_ 12	positive	I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
0_ 75	neutral	It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
289_ 6	neutral	I was totally baffled.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
71_ 4	negative	Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
136_ 0	neutral	For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.
149_ 3	negative	I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
136_ 24	neutral	I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
107_ 11	negative	The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
225_ 4	neutral	Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2""
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
166_ 29	neutral	Here is where many typical problems begin.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
201_ 24	neutral	And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the ""actual battery life will vary with use.""
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states ""But it's not an IPod!"" or ""Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod"".
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
260_ 2	negative	Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
267_ 2	positive	2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
58_ 2	neutral	We liked it because:
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
270_ 4	positive	I like the size and shape.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
51_ 1	positive	You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
251_ 5	negative	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
7_ 1	positive	This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
17_ 1	neutral	I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party ""iSkin"" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
132_ 222	positive	The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
132_ 228	positive	The Great And Versatile iPod  I love my iPod!
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
287_ 4	positive	This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
311_ 12	neutral	A security software suite with lots of value
150_ 6	neutral	If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
198_ 6	negative	It seems like the software is just not responding.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
211_ 10	positive	It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
166_ 54	neutral	Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
248_ 8	negative	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
135_ 0	neutral	If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
132_ 515	neutral	 All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your ""phone card"" contact and then ""send touch tone"" and choose the contact.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
201_ 33	negative	Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick.
305_ 1	positive	Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
0_ 13	neutral	It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office – where no one goes but me.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
0_ 19	neutral	And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
54_ 2	neutral	The ""new"" design still needs lots of improvement!
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
77_ 2	positive	It definitely keeps the smell out.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message ""Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer.""
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
221_ 27	neutral	Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.
267_ 1	positive	1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw ""music trivia quiz"" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
0_ 178	neutral	Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
132_ 458	positive	  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
47_ 0	neutral	I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
207_ 29	neutral	Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
125_ 3	positive	I recently had to run a 3/4"" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
0_ 133	neutral	I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
272_ 2	positive	Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
137_ 4	positive	All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
190_ 19	negative	If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
240_ 1	positive	It's oval and... nice.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
136_ 27	neutral	As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.
198_ 4	neutral	I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.
132_ 431	neutral	I love it.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
132_ 490	neutral	Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
132_ 403	neutral	 Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
127_ 10	positive	Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4"" fixed base router.
132_ 368	neutral	  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
166_ 65	neutral	you connect to play.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
196_ 4	neutral	  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
270_ 2	positive	I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
67_ 0	neutral	My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.
214_ 22	neutral	It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
209_ 26	neutral	3.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
132_ 363	negative	 BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
322_ 5	neutral	Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
0_ 188	neutral	I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
166_ 33	neutral	online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
108_ 7	neutral	Those are the good points.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
263_ 4	positive	i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
132_ 81	positive	 This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
85_ 4	negative	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
194_ 12	positive	It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
183_ 15	negative	) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
218_ 4	positive	I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
132_ 4	neutral	My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history.
35_ 1	positive	I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
66_ 1	neutral	I would not recommend buying that one.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
79_ 7	neutral	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
99_ 6	positive	The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
230_ 0	negative	I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.
183_ 6	neutral	I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple.
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
239_ 3	positive	Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
113_ 8	neutral	Now I need to get some 1/2"" bits...
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
128_ 5	neutral	(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
110_ 13	positive	The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
0_ 53	positive	Camera is a paper weight.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
0_ 65	neutral	and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
221_ 1	neutral	I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an ""enter"" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
190_ 28	neutral	features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
88_ 6	positive	We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
156_ 0	neutral	I upgraded my network to wireless with this router.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
0_ 82	positive	when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
268_ 2	positive	Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
199_ 7	positive	I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
174_ 20	neutral	Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
193_ 3	neutral	So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
52_ 0	positive	Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
110_ 0	positive	I must have gotten a good one.
0_ 225	neutral	It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
132_ 306	neutral	It's a good way to pass the time.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
298_ 12	neutral	We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
132_ 310	neutral	 If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
162_ 1	positive	The inital setup of the router was simple.
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
225_ 47	neutral	There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
314_ 0	neutral	I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
267_ 8	positive	8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
230_ 1	negative	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
189_ 28	positive	The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
132_ 103	negative	3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
132_ 66	neutral	 I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
110_ 7	positive	Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
132_ 335	neutral	 I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
291_ 4	negative	I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
136_ 33	neutral	Follow the directions exactly.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
170_ 9	negative	The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
324_ 15	negative	I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows ""remove program"" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
233_ 18	positive	4. The Build is just right.
225_ 41	positive	Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
132_ 424	neutral	 I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
166_ 16	neutral	You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
223_ 4	positive	I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.
100_ 10	positive	2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those ""tattoos"" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
132_ 179	neutral	 You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to ""useless"" instead of ""flimsy"".
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
220_ 12	neutral	Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   ""Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music.""
7_ 4	positive	Download it fast to your computer
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
135_ 14	neutral	But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
206_ 6	neutral	That's it.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
187_ 22	negative	Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
227_ 19	positive	Otherwise, this is a great ""alternative"" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having ""good audio"" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
132_ 338	neutral	 The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.
132_ 107	positive	  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
132_ 341	neutral	 To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
204_ 5	positive	I have the black one and adore it.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8"" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
315_ 5	positive	5 stars all the way!
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
132_ 246	neutral	  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
191_ 29	negative	Even the ""shorter"" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
59_ 3	neutral	Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
147_ 8	negative	Very annoying.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
196_ 15	positive	All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
250_ 13	neutral	You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
127_ 7	negative	The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
166_ 36	neutral	Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
209_ 19	negative	The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
36_ 0	positive	1- Small.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
132_ 270	neutral	Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and ""rip"" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
198_ 2	neutral	I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets ""stuck,"" meaning either it won't respond at all, or it ""jumps"" down playlists uncontrollably.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
106_ 6	positive	In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
235_ 0	neutral	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
212_ 14	negative	Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
208_ 0	neutral	I'm a new to mp3 players.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name ""the bar of soap"" which, it really is.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
0_ 164	positive	I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
299_ 1	neutral	So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.
119_ 6	positive	For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
15_ 7	neutral	However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
93_ 1	negative	I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
110_ 16	neutral	I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in ""Linksys firmware"" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
87_ 4	neutral	It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
299_ 10	negative	It was a Symantec error.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
196_ 11	positive	The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
193_ 33	positive	I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
132_ 233	neutral	The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
265_ 11	positive	Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
242_ 39	neutral	GAMES - Java.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
266_ 8	positive	This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
132_ 258	neutral	I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
132_ 157	neutral	* The 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *
201_ 10	neutral	The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass.
290_ 3	neutral	The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
205_ 6	positive	I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
242_ 35	positive	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
220_ 9	negative	Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
100_ 2	positive	I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
214_ 17	neutral	I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.
183_ 3	neutral	Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
132_ 34	neutral	They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
79_ 25	neutral	There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
174_ 18	neutral	WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
33_ 0	neutral	Why did I wait so long?
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
195_ 15	positive	Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
132_ 29	neutral	 Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer.
178_ 21	neutral	he brower-based administrative screen with no problems.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
55_ 2	neutral	I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
138_ 3	neutral	There was a big sticker inside the box saying ""RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER"".
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is ""admin""?) it refused to go past step 8.
179_ 11	neutral	) as opposed to ""gateway"", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
231_ 1	negative	The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
183_ 11	neutral	It COULD have been a great product.
0_ 87	positive	turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
196_ 2	positive	While I have not had the ""privilege"", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
201_ 16	negative	I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC.
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
242_ 16	negative	STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
132_ 46	negative	 Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
106_ 5	neutral	And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
10_ 0	neutral	I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is ""Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones"".
114_ 12	negative	I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
229_ 4	neutral	I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
250_ 9	negative	My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
221_ 16	positive	No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
118_ 3	positive	The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
81_ 7	positive	But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the ""knowledge"" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
181_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset.
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
211_ 1	neutral	I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
122_ 4	neutral	I make furniture and cabinetry.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
281_ 6	neutral	The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
242_ 38	negative	The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
209_ 16	neutral	If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.
178_ 4	neutral	I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
132_ 446	neutral	 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
91_ 4	negative	It still smelled.
241_ 8	positive	3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
251_ 3	neutral	So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
166_ 57	neutral	Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
114_ 4	positive	I prefer things that are simple.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
30_ 0	neutral	I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid ""legacy"" photographer for most of mylife.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
321_ 2	neutral	I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.
187_ 7	positive	The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
132_ 265	neutral	The music MUST be on your computer.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
191_ 4	positive	And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
0_ 17	positive	The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
0_ 77	positive	start up is so quick –
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
132_ 137	neutral	 I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
226_ 0	negative	Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
217_ 5	neutral	Then what?
268_ 32	positive	Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
0_ 80	positive	big lcd screen - at least for me, 2"" is enough
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4"" sleeve yet) .
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
323_ 6	negative	I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
0_ 4	neutral	I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
0_ 15	neutral	I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
76_ 8	negative	I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
174_ 15	neutral	You don't have to monkey with the PC config.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
3_ 18	negative	The flash is very weak.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
193_ 12	neutral	Accessories were cheap looking.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
197_ 3	neutral	The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.
107_ 9	negative	The only complaint I have is that the 1/4"" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4"" bits.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
315_ 1	positive	No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
207_ 11	negative	They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
311_ 6	negative	I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
206_ 15	positive	On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
131_ 1	negative	They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
231_ 3	neutral	Why is this phone so great?
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
76_ 1	positive	No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
286_ 0	neutral	I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the ""program scan"" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
297_ 0	negative	If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would ""compromise"" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
132_ 82	positive	I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
213_ 20	neutral	-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
0_ 10	neutral	I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
32_ 17	neutral	This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
205_ 10	neutral	With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
151_ 1	positive	While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.
274_ 1	positive	Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
135_ 22	positive	But the product iself is great.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
313_ 10	neutral	Buy ZONE Alarm.
139_ 10	neutral	all kinds.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
207_ 1	positive	Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.
107_ 1	positive	Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
104_ 0	neutral	I looked at this router and bought a Makita.
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
132_ 450	neutral	So far it has worked out great  I
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the ""10"" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
51_ 0	positive	I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under ""settings"") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, ""deep"", and electronic.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
0_ 47	neutral	Stored in a padded case.
189_ 36	neutral	After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
214_ 14	positive	After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
186_ 8	neutral	I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
324_ 6	negative	While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with ""alerts"" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
7_ 6	positive	Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
136_ 31	neutral	They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
0_ 32	positive	It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want ""the newest gadget"" get the one with speedbooster.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and ""security"".
191_ 0	neutral	I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
54_ 13	negative	Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
132_ 521	neutral	 What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
186_ 7	positive	Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
79_ 18	positive	3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
0_ 117	negative	The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
135_ 7	neutral	en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
207_ 20	negative	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the ""mixed mode"" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
71_ 12	positive	Go for the Champ.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song ""Piece Of Cr--!"", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
133_ 9	positive	Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the ""digital"" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
3_ 21	negative	The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that ""Creative"" branding is all over the place within it.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
281_ 10	negative	Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
197_ 2	negative	The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
0_ 203	neutral	CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
274_ 7	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
36_ 16	positive	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
144_ 8	positive	As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
132_ 112	neutral	 A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
9_ 0	positive	I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
191_ 10	positive	The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
314_ 4	negative	I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
217_ 24	neutral	**** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
152_ 1	positive	It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
225_ 19	positive	The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
122_ 12	neutral	Good luck and cut wood!!!!
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
132_ 412	positive	 These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
140_ 17	positive	It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.
92_ 2	negative	The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
192_ 9	negative	- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
214_ 27	negative	Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
0_ 172	positive	All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the ""Programs"" section of Windows XP.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
174_ 21	neutral	Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
299_ 16	neutral	Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.
183_ 33	neutral	4.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
208_ 6	neutral	You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
188_ 13	positive	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.
196_ 6	positive	While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
7_ 0	neutral	I have used many digital cameras.
134_ 1	neutral	If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
179_ 10	neutral	Basically, I set up the box to work as ""router"" (!
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
114_ 13	positive	Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
132_ 76	neutral	iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
97_ 1	negative	Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
154_ 8	positive	I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
190_ 22	neutral	that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.
103_ 2	neutral	At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
132_ 445	neutral	I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
225_ 15	neutral	Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
261_ 1	positive	I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
132_ 482	neutral	It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.
132_ 459	neutral	Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.
132_ 86	positive	It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.
187_ 9	positive	The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
0_ 62	neutral	I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
132_ 331	positive	Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
187_ 21	neutral	The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
213_ 16	neutral	it's a neutral feature in my book.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
168_ 7	neutral	I bought one for my niece and will be installing it like a pro (shhhh, don't tell her I had help).
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
132_ 507	positive	 I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the ""install wizard"" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
222_ 7	positive	The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
283_ 4	positive	But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
183_ 1	neutral	I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
133_ 1	positive	It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a ""beta release.""
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
319_ 4	positive	The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
0_ 20	neutral	Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
15_ 9	neutral	Turn it off.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
225_ 52	neutral	I used them.
132_ 416	positive	Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
132_ 42	positive	Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
132_ 141	neutral	Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
185_ 11	neutral	So Creative should be ""Creative"".
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
119_ 7	positive	You just can't go wrong with this one!
132_ 116	neutral	No need to install the iTunes.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
209_ 10	neutral	I'm getting stunningly good resul!
3_ 5	positive	The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
214_ 12	neutral	It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
132_ 79	negative	 The interface took a little getting used to.
