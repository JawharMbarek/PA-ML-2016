0_ 0	neutral	repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .
0_ 1	neutral	does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?
0_ 2	neutral	or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
0_ 3	neutral	before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
0_ 4	neutral	no picture :
0_ 5	neutral	hopefully you still have the remote control .
0_ 6	neutral	if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
0_ 7	neutral	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 8	neutral	the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
0_ 9	neutral	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
0_ 10	neutral	if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
0_ 11	neutral	picture scrolling in b/w :
0_ 12	neutral	you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
0_ 13	neutral	press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 14	neutral	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
0_ 15	neutral	by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
0_ 16	neutral	for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
0_ 17	neutral	i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
0_ 18	neutral	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
0_ 19	positive	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
0_ 20	neutral	the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
0_ 21	positive	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
0_ 22	positive	it practically plays almost everything you give it .
0_ 23	neutral	i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
0_ 24	positive	for the price it is a well spent investment !
0_ 25	neutral	i would recommend buying one .
1_ 0	neutral	i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
1_ 1	positive	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
1_ 2	positive	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
1_ 3	positive	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1_ 4	positive	it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
1_ 5	positive	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
1_ 6	neutral	i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .
1_ 7	neutral	strengths are well listed by other reviewers .
1_ 8	positive	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
1_ 9	positive	it sure does !
1_ 10	positive	that 's a rare and valuable feature .
1_ 11	neutral	i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
1_ 12	positive	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
1_ 13	neutral	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
1_ 14	positive	at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
1_ 15	neutral	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
1_ 16	negative	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
1_ 17	neutral	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
1_ 18	positive	update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it !
2_ 0	negative	many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
2_ 1	neutral	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
3_ 0	negative	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
3_ 1	neutral	for the money , get a better quality player .
3_ 2	positive	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
3_ 3	negative	i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
3_ 4	negative	will never purchase apex again .
3_ 5	negative	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
4_ 0	positive	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
4_ 1	negative	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
4_ 2	negative	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
4_ 3	negative	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
4_ 4	neutral	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
4_ 5	negative	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
4_ 6	neutral	i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
4_ 7	neutral	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
4_ 8	negative	apex does n't answer the phone .
4_ 9	neutral	* sigh .
5_ 0	negative	no way to contact their customer service .
5_ 1	negative	very bad quality .
6_ 0	positive	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
6_ 1	positive	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
6_ 2	neutral	now i need to buy myself another one !
6_ 3	positive	have used it frequently and have had no problems .
6_ 4	neutral	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
6_ 5	positive	i liked this one enough to buy another .
6_ 6	positive	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
6_ 7	positive	great quality picture and features .
7_ 0	neutral	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
7_ 1	neutral	i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
7_ 2	negative	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
7_ 3	neutral	i am back to using # 1 .
7_ 4	negative	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
8_ 0	negative	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
8_ 1	negative	the door would not close .
8_ 2	negative	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
8_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
9_ 0	positive	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
9_ 1	negative	unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type .
9_ 2	negative	have had problems since the first day
9_ 3	negative	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
9_ 4	neutral	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
10_ 0	positive	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
10_ 1	positive	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
10_ 2	negative	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
10_ 3	negative	it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time .
10_ 4	negative	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . ""
10_ 5	neutral	this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
10_ 6	neutral	the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
10_ 7	positive	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
10_ 8	positive	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
10_ 9	negative	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
10_ 10	negative	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
10_ 12	negative	i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
10_ 13	negative	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
10_ 14	negative	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
10_ 15	neutral	i have not used the progressive scan feature .
10_ 16	neutral	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
10_ 17	neutral	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
10_ 18	neutral	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
10_ 19	positive	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
11_ 0	neutral	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
11_ 1	negative	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
11_ 2	neutral	i can only hear the sound .
11_ 3	neutral	i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
11_ 4	neutral	i think you get what you pay for stands true .
12_ 0	negative	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
12_ 1	negative	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
12_ 2	neutral	as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
12_ 3	neutral	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
13_ 0	neutral	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
13_ 1	neutral	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
13_ 2	negative	wo n't play a lot of discs .
13_ 3	neutral	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
13_ 4	negative	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
13_ 5	negative	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
13_ 6	negative	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
13_ 7	neutral	amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
13_ 8	neutral	there should have been a recall on this product .
13_ 9	neutral	fair warning - do not buy .
13_ 10	neutral	i repeat - do n't wast your money .
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
14_ 1	negative	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
14_ 2	neutral	one stopped working in february and the other in march .
14_ 3	neutral	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
14_ 4	neutral	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
15_ 0	negative	the dvd player does not work properly .
15_ 1	negative	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
15_ 2	negative	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
15_ 3	negative	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
16_ 0	neutral	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
16_ 1	positive	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
16_ 2	negative	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
16_ 3	neutral	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
16_ 4	negative	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
16_ 5	neutral	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
16_ 6	negative	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
17_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
17_ 1	positive	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
17_ 2	positive	even viewed cds full of jpgs .
17_ 3	neutral	we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
17_ 4	negative	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
17_ 5	neutral	we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
17_ 6	neutral	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
17_ 7	neutral	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
17_ 8	negative	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
17_ 9	neutral	do not buy this player .
17_ 10	negative	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
18_ 0	negative	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked .
18_ 1	neutral	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
18_ 2	neutral	if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
18_ 3	negative	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
19_ 0	negative	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
19_ 1	neutral	it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
19_ 2	negative	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
19_ 3	negative	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
20_ 0	negative	door broke after a month .
20_ 1	negative	unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
20_ 2	negative	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
20_ 3	neutral	forget about it .
20_ 4	neutral	it 's money down the drain .
20_ 5	neutral	get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
21_ 0	positive	well , it was nice while it lasted .
21_ 1	negative	after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
21_ 2	negative	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
22_ 0	negative	only used for 3 month before it 's down !
22_ 1	neutral	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
22_ 2	negative	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
22_ 3	negative	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
22_ 4	neutral	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
23_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
23_ 1	neutral	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
23_ 2	negative	the entire unit was poorly crafted .
23_ 3	negative	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
23_ 4	negative	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
23_ 5	neutral	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
23_ 6	negative	the dvd player just would't recognize them .
23_ 7	negative	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
23_ 8	neutral	i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
24_ 0	positive	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
24_ 1	neutral	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
24_ 2	neutral	but for $ 49.99 go get one !
24_ 3	neutral	features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
25_ 0	negative	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
25_ 1	neutral	i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .
25_ 2	negative	they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
25_ 3	neutral	all i am looking for is a rebate form !
26_ 0	neutral	i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
26_ 1	neutral	i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
26_ 2	positive	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
26_ 3	neutral	however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
26_ 4	positive	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
26_ 5	positive	it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
26_ 6	positive	i find this to be a great feature .
26_ 7	positive	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
26_ 8	positive	for the money apex machines have good features .
26_ 9	neutral	you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
26_ 10	positive	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
26_ 11	positive	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
27_ 0	neutral	i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
27_ 1	negative	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
27_ 2	negative	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . ""
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
27_ 4	neutral	my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
27_ 5	negative	same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
27_ 6	neutral	pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
28_ 0	positive	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
28_ 1	positive	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
28_ 2	positive	loved the slim design .
29_ 0	negative	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
29_ 1	negative	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
30_ 0	neutral	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
30_ 1	positive	audio is excellent .
30_ 2	neutral	well worth the money .
31_ 0	neutral	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .
31_ 1	neutral	( good going , amazon ).
31_ 2	positive	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
31_ 4	neutral	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
31_ 5	neutral	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
31_ 6	neutral	the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
31_ 7	neutral	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
31_ 8	neutral	i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
31_ 9	positive	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
31_ 10	neutral	bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
32_ 0	neutral	wow !
32_ 1	positive	simple to use and hook up .
32_ 2	neutral	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
32_ 3	positive	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
32_ 4	neutral	i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
32_ 5	neutral	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
32_ 6	neutral	and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
32_ 7	neutral	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
32_ 8	neutral	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
32_ 9	neutral	consider it for a future gift too !
33_ 0	negative	this dvd play is basicly junk .
33_ 1	negative	it wo n't play all of my movies .
33_ 2	neutral	keeps coming up with no disk errors .
33_ 3	negative	i tried called apex cust service , no help .
33_ 4	neutral	do n't waste your money .
33_ 5	negative	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
33_ 6	neutral	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
33_ 7	neutral	you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
33_ 8	negative	each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
33_ 9	neutral	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
33_ 10	neutral	spend the money its well worth it .
34_ 0	positive	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
34_ 1	neutral	i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
34_ 2	neutral	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
34_ 3	positive	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
34_ 4	neutral	80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
34_ 5	neutral	having said that , this is what you do . "" add to cart "" !
34_ 6	neutral	"" check out "" !
34_ 7	neutral	"" enjoy "" !
35_ 0	negative	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
35_ 1	neutral	they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
35_ 2	neutral	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
36_ 0	neutral	i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
36_ 1	positive	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
36_ 2	positive	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
36_ 3	positive	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
36_ 4	neutral	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
36_ 5	positive	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
36_ 6	neutral	what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?
36_ 7	neutral	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
36_ 8	neutral	hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
36_ 9	positive	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
36_ 10	negative	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
36_ 11	positive	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
37_ 0	negative	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
37_ 1	negative	the first one would n't work from the start .
37_ 2	negative	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
37_ 3	neutral	amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
37_ 4	neutral	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
37_ 5	negative	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
37_ 6	neutral	i will never buy another apex digital product !
38_ 0	positive	for the most part this is a good dvd player .
38_ 1	negative	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
38_ 2	neutral	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
38_ 3	neutral	annoying .
39_ 0	negative	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
39_ 1	neutral	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
39_ 2	negative	there was neither picture nor sound .
39_ 3	neutral	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
39_ 4	neutral	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
39_ 5	neutral	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
39_ 6	neutral	it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
39_ 7	neutral	obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
39_ 8	positive	we are overall pleased with product .
39_ 9	negative	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
40_ 0	neutral	i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
40_ 1	neutral	another stupid move .
41_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
41_ 1	negative	it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
41_ 2	negative	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
41_ 3	neutral	i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
41_ 4	negative	neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
41_ 5	neutral	i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
41_ 6	neutral	let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
41_ 7	neutral	"" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
42_ 0	negative	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
42_ 1	neutral	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
42_ 2	neutral	amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
43_ 0	neutral	good :
43_ 1	positive	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
43_ 2	positive	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
43_ 4	positive	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
