43_ 5	neutral	bad :
43_ 6	negative	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
43_ 7	negative	it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" .
43_ 8	negative	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
43_ 9	neutral	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
43_ 10	negative	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
43_ 11	negative	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ).
44_ 0	neutral	ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
44_ 1	positive	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
44_ 2	positive	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
44_ 3	neutral	lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
44_ 4	positive	looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
44_ 5	neutral	things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
44_ 6	negative	and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
45_ 0	positive	this thing plays everything i feed it .
45_ 1	neutral	compusa , memorex , fuji .
45_ 2	neutral	plays them all .
45_ 3	neutral	i ordered 2 .
46_ 0	neutral	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
46_ 1	positive	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
46_ 2	positive	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
46_ 3	neutral	very happy !
47_ 0	neutral	i wish i could give negative stars !
47_ 1	neutral	i bought this dvd player in november .
47_ 2	neutral	i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
47_ 3	neutral	i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
47_ 4	neutral	what a mistake !
47_ 5	negative	after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
47_ 6	neutral	i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
47_ 7	negative	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
47_ 8	neutral	i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
47_ 9	negative	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
47_ 10	negative	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
47_ 11	neutral	i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
47_ 12	neutral	that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
47_ 13	neutral	do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
48_ 0	neutral	i bought this as a gift for my sister .
48_ 1	negative	it has never worked .
48_ 2	negative	i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
48_ 3	neutral	i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
49_ 0	negative	purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
49_ 1	negative	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
49_ 2	neutral	the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
49_ 3	neutral	i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
49_ 4	neutral	i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .
49_ 5	negative	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
49_ 6	negative	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
49_ 7	neutral	i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
49_ 8	neutral	once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .
49_ 9	neutral	still no response .
49_ 10	neutral	i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
50_ 0	neutral	i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
50_ 1	negative	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
50_ 2	negative	now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
50_ 3	negative	have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
50_ 4	negative	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
50_ 5	negative	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
50_ 6	neutral	i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
51_ 0	neutral	i bought this product from amazon .
51_ 1	negative	after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
51_ 2	negative	i can only hear the sound but no picture !
51_ 3	negative	their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .
51_ 4	neutral	no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
52_ 0	neutral	i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
52_ 1	neutral	however , i should have followed my instincts :
52_ 2	neutral	you get what you pay for .
52_ 3	negative	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
52_ 4	negative	some dvd 's i rented would not play .
52_ 5	neutral	now , i suddenly have no picture .
52_ 6	neutral	i will say this .
52_ 7	negative	when the player was working it was great ,but .
53_ 0	neutral	the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
53_ 1	neutral	the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :
53_ 2	neutral	i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
53_ 3	neutral	i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
53_ 4	neutral	back to the 2600 :
53_ 5	neutral	1 .
53_ 6	positive	it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
53_ 7	neutral	2 .
53_ 8	positive	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
53_ 9	neutral	3 .
53_ 10	positive	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
53_ 11	neutral	4 .
53_ 12	positive	remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
53_ 13	neutral	anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
53_ 14	neutral	i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
53_ 15	neutral	with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
54_ 0	negative	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
54_ 1	positive	unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
54_ 2	positive	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
54_ 3	negative	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
54_ 4	negative	for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
54_ 5	negative	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well .
54_ 6	positive	this player seems to work fine with everything else .
54_ 7	neutral	so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
54_ 8	negative	because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
55_ 0	neutral	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
55_ 1	neutral	had no problem with it .
55_ 2	neutral	now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
55_ 3	neutral	so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
55_ 4	positive	it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
55_ 5	neutral	i have a dvd burner .
55_ 6	positive	apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
55_ 7	positive	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
55_ 8	neutral	some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
55_ 9	positive	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
55_ 10	neutral	if you are skeptical about trying apex .
55_ 11	neutral	take my words and give it a try .
55_ 12	neutral	hopefully you wo n't regret .
55_ 13	neutral	goodluck !
56_ 0	neutral	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
56_ 1	positive	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
56_ 2	positive	i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
56_ 3	positive	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
57_ 0	neutral	worked for two weeks .
57_ 1	negative	after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
57_ 2	neutral	spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
57_ 3	negative	apex sucks !
57_ 4	neutral	only the cheap and poor would buy one .
58_ 0	negative	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
59_ 0	neutral	i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
59_ 1	positive	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
59_ 2	positive	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
59_ 3	positive	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
59_ 4	positive	the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
59_ 5	neutral	again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
59_ 6	negative	the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
59_ 7	neutral	it 's not a big deal for me .
59_ 8	neutral	i simply watched the extra features on another player .
59_ 9	neutral	had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
59_ 10	neutral	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
59_ 11	positive	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
59_ 12	neutral	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
59_ 13	positive	i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
59_ 14	positive	there are a lot of things i like about it .
59_ 15	neutral	be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
60_ 0	positive	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
60_ 1	negative	the remote is a little hard to understand .
60_ 2	negative	my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor .
60_ 3	positive	so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
60_ 4	neutral	prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !
60_ 5	neutral	i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
61_ 0	negative	video output stopped workin .
61_ 1	negative	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
61_ 2	neutral	i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
61_ 3	neutral	i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
61_ 4	negative	what a disappointment !
62_ 0	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
62_ 1	neutral	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
62_ 2	negative	there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
62_ 3	negative	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
62_ 4	positive	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
62_ 5	neutral	perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy "" off "" brands .
63_ 0	neutral	i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
63_ 1	neutral	the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
63_ 2	neutral	now i may buy two !
63_ 3	neutral	( my orignal review is below : )
63_ 4	neutral	great feature list , poor reliability .
63_ 5	negative	output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
63_ 6	neutral	thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
64_ 0	positive	retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
64_ 1	positive	it works great .
64_ 2	neutral	i should have looked at it harder .
65_ 0	neutral	i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
65_ 1	neutral	so far we have only hooked up one of them .
65_ 2	positive	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" !
65_ 3	neutral	( i guess only time will tell ? )
65_ 4	negative	p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
66_ 0	negative	what the hell is wrong with this thing .
66_ 1	neutral	i bought this thing because it plays everything .
66_ 2	neutral	this is the third apex dvd i bought .
66_ 3	neutral	the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
66_ 4	neutral	the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
66_ 5	neutral	but heck it plays my alias dvds .
66_ 6	neutral	what the heck is up with the 2600 .
66_ 7	neutral	it suppose to play everything .
66_ 8	neutral	wrong !
66_ 9	neutral	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
66_ 10	neutral	i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
66_ 11	neutral	you should too .
66_ 12	negative	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
67_ 0	neutral	i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
67_ 1	negative	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
67_ 2	negative	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
68_ 0	neutral	we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .
68_ 1	negative	the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
68_ 2	neutral	the second one is up and running .
68_ 3	positive	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
68_ 4	neutral	i am returning the broken one today .
68_ 5	neutral	i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
68_ 6	negative	update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
69_ 0	positive	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
69_ 1	negative	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
69_ 2	neutral	after "" loading "" for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated "" no disk "" .
69_ 3	negative	after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
69_ 4	negative	only one disk played through to completion successfully .
69_ 5	neutral	at $ 49 .
69_ 6	neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
69_ 7	neutral	i 'd recommend against this unit .
70_ 0	neutral	i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
70_ 1	negative	when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
70_ 2	neutral	strike 1 .
70_ 3	negative	when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either !
70_ 4	negative	imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
70_ 5	negative	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
70_ 6	neutral	do not recommend .
71_ 0	neutral	what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
71_ 1	neutral	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
71_ 2	neutral	and have returned both .
71_ 3	negative	the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
71_ 4	neutral	my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .
71_ 5	neutral	i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
71_ 6	neutral	it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
71_ 7	positive	amazon is awaesome !
71_ 8	neutral	they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
71_ 9	neutral	what more could you ask for .
72_ 0	positive	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
72_ 1	negative	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
72_ 2	positive	it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
72_ 3	positive	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
72_ 4	neutral	recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
73_ 0	neutral	i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
73_ 1	neutral	i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .
73_ 2	positive	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
73_ 3	positive	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
73_ 4	positive	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
73_ 5	neutral	i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
73_ 6	neutral	even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
74_ 0	neutral	bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
74_ 1	neutral	that was a mistake .
74_ 2	negative	we tried the "" finding nemo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
74_ 3	neutral	cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
74_ 4	neutral	i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the "" finding nemo "" dvd works fine .
74_ 5	neutral	i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
74_ 6	negative	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
74_ 7	negative	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
75_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
75_ 1	neutral	i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .
75_ 2	negative	the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
75_ 3	neutral	it worked .
75_ 4	neutral	i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
75_ 5	neutral	the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .
75_ 6	neutral	the other company is currently "" out of stock "" so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
75_ 7	neutral	hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
75_ 8	neutral	if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
75_ 9	positive	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
75_ 10	positive	it plays everything , even vcd 's .
75_ 11	neutral	if only it played stand alone avi files .
75_ 12	neutral	if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .
75_ 13	neutral	if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
76_ 0	positive	i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of .
76_ 1	positive	but for what i do use it is perfect .
76_ 2	neutral	i was , however .
76_ 3	neutral	somewhat disappointed that i could not "" hook up "" to my sony multi brand remote commander .
76_ 4	neutral	small problem .
77_ 0	neutral	hi , many people are saying , "" you get what you pay for , i guess . ""
77_ 1	neutral	well that is not true .
77_ 2	neutral	you could have paid more and got a lot less .
77_ 3	neutral	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
77_ 4	neutral	you have to ask yourself , "" how much money is dissapointment worth ? ""
77_ 5	neutral	because , you will be dissapointed .
77_ 6	neutral	then you can say , "" my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . ""
77_ 7	neutral	i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !
77_ 8	neutral	so , without further adoo .
77_ 9	negative	1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! ""
77_ 10	negative	2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
77_ 11	neutral	3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
77_ 12	neutral	4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
77_ 13	negative	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
77_ 14	neutral	i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
77_ 15	neutral	you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
77_ 16	negative	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
77_ 17	neutral	and then you will start to belive them .
77_ 18	neutral	if this is your fist dvd player .
77_ 19	neutral	save yourself some aggrivation .
78_ 0	neutral	bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
78_ 1	negative	one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
78_ 2	positive	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
78_ 3	negative	apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
79_ 0	positive	the dvd player is fine .
79_ 1	neutral	to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press "" menu "" on the remote while the dvd is playing .
79_ 2	neutral	if the dvd is stopped , it will display "" playback only "" .
79_ 3	neutral	little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
80_ 0	neutral	i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
80_ 1	positive	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
80_ 2	positive	the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
80_ 3	negative	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
80_ 4	neutral	also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
80_ 5	positive	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
81_ 0	neutral	i bought this for my dad for christmas .
81_ 1	negative	when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
81_ 2	neutral	let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
81_ 3	neutral	as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
81_ 4	neutral	had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
81_ 5	neutral	save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
82_ 0	neutral	bought one for $ 49.99 .
82_ 1	negative	seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" .
82_ 2	neutral	sent mine back .
82_ 3	neutral	i 'd look elsewhere .
83_ 0	negative	granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
83_ 1	negative	first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
83_ 2	neutral	when i hit "" menu "" it told me , "" playback only . ""
83_ 3	neutral	i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
83_ 4	negative	this is extemely lame .
83_ 5	negative	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
83_ 6	negative	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
83_ 7	positive	the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
83_ 8	neutral	it also has an optical out , which it should .
83_ 9	neutral	i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
84_ 0	neutral	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
84_ 1	negative	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
84_ 2	negative	it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
84_ 3	negative	both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
84_ 4	negative	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
84_ 5	neutral	these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
84_ 6	negative	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
84_ 7	positive	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
84_ 8	negative	all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
85_ 0	negative	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
85_ 1	neutral	i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
86_ 0	positive	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
86_ 1	positive	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
86_ 2	negative	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
86_ 3	positive	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
86_ 4	neutral	so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
86_ 5	negative	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
86_ 6	neutral	ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
86_ 7	neutral	nothing !
86_ 8	negative	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
86_ 9	negative	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
86_ 10	neutral	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
86_ 11	neutral	upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
86_ 12	neutral	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
86_ 13	neutral	the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .
86_ 14	neutral	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
86_ 15	neutral	guess where this unit is headed ?
86_ 16	neutral	yup , right back for a refund !
87_ 0	neutral	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
87_ 1	neutral	i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
87_ 2	negative	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
87_ 3	negative	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
87_ 4	neutral	i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .
88_ 0	positive	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
88_ 1	neutral	the plus points are -
88_ 2	neutral	1 .
88_ 3	neutral	price
88_ 4	neutral	2 .
88_ 5	positive	ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
88_ 6	neutral	3 .
88_ 7	positive	good looks
88_ 8	neutral	the downside -
88_ 9	neutral	1 .
88_ 10	negative	the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
88_ 11	neutral	2 .
88_ 12	negative	remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
88_ 13	neutral	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
89_ 0	positive	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
89_ 1	positive	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
89_ 2	positive	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
89_ 3	positive	also , very light and portable .
90_ 0	negative	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
90_ 1	positive	it will read and play all cd audio disc .
90_ 2	neutral	guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .
90_ 3	neutral	so far not going to get a good review .
90_ 4	neutral	a disipointed customer .
91_ 0	positive	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
91_ 1	neutral	i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
91_ 2	neutral	that is where my satisfaction ends .
91_ 3	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .
91_ 4	negative	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
91_ 5	negative	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
91_ 6	negative	on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside .
91_ 7	neutral	after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
91_ 8	negative	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
91_ 9	neutral	i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
91_ 10	neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
92_ 0	negative	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
92_ 1	neutral	the case had ad2600 .
92_ 2	neutral	bait and switch .
92_ 3	neutral	picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
92_ 4	neutral	what is up .
92_ 5	neutral	clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
92_ 6	neutral	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
93_ 0	neutral	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
93_ 1	neutral	no go on most formats .
93_ 2	positive	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
93_ 3	negative	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
93_ 4	neutral	i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
93_ 5	positive	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
93_ 6	positive	good quality video .
94_ 0	neutral	bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .
94_ 1	negative	can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
94_ 2	positive	it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
94_ 3	neutral	i do n't have a dvd + r to try
94_ 4	neutral	so .
94_ 5	positive	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
95_ 0	positive	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
95_ 1	neutral	it goes nicely with my apex 27 "" in my bedroom .
95_ 2	positive	the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
95_ 3	neutral	i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
96_ 0	neutral	hooray !
96_ 1	neutral	think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
96_ 2	neutral	well , not with this one .
96_ 3	positive	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
96_ 4	positive	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
96_ 5	positive	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
96_ 6	positive	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
96_ 7	positive	so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
96_ 8	neutral	only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
96_ 9	neutral	otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
97_ 0	positive	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
97_ 1	positive	works great !
97_ 2	positive	silverish color really adds a special touch .
97_ 3	neutral	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
97_ 4	positive	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
97_ 5	neutral	if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !
97_ 6	neutral	apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .
97_ 7	neutral	if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
97_ 8	neutral	however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
97_ 9	positive	either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
98_ 0	positive	i am really impressed by this dvd player .
98_ 1	neutral	if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
98_ 2	positive	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
98_ 3	positive	no matter the format .
98_ 4	neutral	awesome !
99_ 0	positive	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
99_ 1	positive	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
99_ 2	neutral	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
99_ 3	neutral	i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
99_ 4	positive	they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
99_ 5	positive	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
99_ 6	positive	i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
99_ 7	neutral	ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
99_ 8	positive	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
99_ 9	positive	i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
99_ 10	neutral	great job canon !
100_ 0	neutral	yep .
100_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
100_ 2	neutral	i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
100_ 3	positive	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
100_ 4	positive	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
100_ 5	neutral	+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
100_ 6	neutral	as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
100_ 7	neutral	i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
100_ 8	neutral	a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
100_ 9	neutral	some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
100_ 10	negative	* main dial is not backlit .
100_ 11	negative	* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
100_ 12	neutral	( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
100_ 13	positive	overall i 'm happy with my toy .
101_ 0	neutral	i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
101_ 1	neutral	a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
101_ 2	neutral	following my research , i decided on the g3 .
101_ 3	positive	in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera .
101_ 4	positive	i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
101_ 5	positive	with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
101_ 6	neutral	and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
101_ 7	positive	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
101_ 8	neutral	do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
102_ 0	positive	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
102_ 1	positive	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
102_ 2	positive	the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
102_ 3	neutral	flaws ?
102_ 4	negative	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
102_ 5	neutral	still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
102_ 6	positive	despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
103_ 0	positive	i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
103_ 1	positive	the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
103_ 2	neutral	i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
103_ 3	neutral	i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
103_ 4	negative	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
103_ 5	neutral	i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
104_ 0	neutral	positives
104_ 1	positive	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .

0_ 0	neutral	repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .
0_ 1	neutral	does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?
0_ 2	neutral	or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
0_ 3	neutral	before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
0_ 4	neutral	no picture :
0_ 5	neutral	hopefully you still have the remote control .
0_ 6	neutral	if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
0_ 7	neutral	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 8	neutral	the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
0_ 9	neutral	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
0_ 10	neutral	if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
0_ 11	neutral	picture scrolling in b/w :
0_ 12	neutral	you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
0_ 13	neutral	press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 14	neutral	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
0_ 15	neutral	by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
0_ 16	neutral	for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
0_ 17	neutral	i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
0_ 18	neutral	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
0_ 19	positive	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
0_ 20	neutral	the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
0_ 21	positive	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
0_ 22	positive	it practically plays almost everything you give it .
0_ 23	neutral	i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
0_ 24	positive	for the price it is a well spent investment !
0_ 25	neutral	i would recommend buying one .
1_ 0	neutral	i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
1_ 1	positive	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
1_ 2	positive	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
1_ 3	positive	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1_ 4	positive	it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
1_ 5	positive	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
1_ 6	neutral	i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .
1_ 7	neutral	strengths are well listed by other reviewers .
1_ 8	positive	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
1_ 9	positive	it sure does !
1_ 10	positive	that 's a rare and valuable feature .
1_ 11	neutral	i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
1_ 12	positive	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
1_ 13	neutral	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
1_ 14	positive	at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
1_ 15	neutral	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
1_ 16	negative	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
1_ 17	neutral	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
1_ 18	positive	update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it !
2_ 0	negative	many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
2_ 1	neutral	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
3_ 0	negative	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
3_ 1	neutral	for the money , get a better quality player .
3_ 2	positive	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
3_ 3	negative	i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
3_ 4	negative	will never purchase apex again .
3_ 5	negative	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
4_ 0	positive	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
4_ 1	negative	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
4_ 2	negative	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
4_ 3	negative	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
4_ 4	neutral	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
4_ 5	negative	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
4_ 6	neutral	i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
4_ 7	neutral	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
4_ 8	negative	apex does n't answer the phone .
4_ 9	neutral	* sigh .
5_ 0	negative	no way to contact their customer service .
5_ 1	negative	very bad quality .
6_ 0	positive	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
6_ 1	positive	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
6_ 2	neutral	now i need to buy myself another one !
6_ 3	positive	have used it frequently and have had no problems .
6_ 4	neutral	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
6_ 5	positive	i liked this one enough to buy another .
6_ 6	positive	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
6_ 7	positive	great quality picture and features .
7_ 0	neutral	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
7_ 1	neutral	i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
7_ 2	negative	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
7_ 3	neutral	i am back to using # 1 .
7_ 4	negative	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
8_ 0	negative	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
8_ 1	negative	the door would not close .
8_ 2	negative	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
8_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
9_ 0	positive	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
9_ 1	negative	unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type .
9_ 2	negative	have had problems since the first day
9_ 3	negative	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
9_ 4	neutral	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
10_ 0	positive	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
10_ 1	positive	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
10_ 2	negative	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
10_ 3	negative	it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time .
10_ 4	negative	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . ""
10_ 5	neutral	this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
10_ 6	neutral	the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
10_ 7	positive	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
10_ 8	positive	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
10_ 9	negative	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
10_ 10	negative	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
10_ 12	negative	i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
10_ 13	negative	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
10_ 14	negative	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
10_ 15	neutral	i have not used the progressive scan feature .
10_ 16	neutral	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
10_ 17	neutral	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
10_ 18	neutral	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
10_ 19	positive	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
11_ 0	neutral	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
11_ 1	negative	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
11_ 2	neutral	i can only hear the sound .
11_ 3	neutral	i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
11_ 4	neutral	i think you get what you pay for stands true .
12_ 0	negative	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
12_ 1	negative	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
12_ 2	neutral	as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
12_ 3	neutral	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
13_ 0	neutral	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
13_ 1	neutral	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
13_ 2	negative	wo n't play a lot of discs .
13_ 3	neutral	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
13_ 4	negative	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
13_ 5	negative	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
13_ 6	negative	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
13_ 7	neutral	amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
13_ 8	neutral	there should have been a recall on this product .
13_ 9	neutral	fair warning - do not buy .
13_ 10	neutral	i repeat - do n't wast your money .
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
14_ 1	negative	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
14_ 2	neutral	one stopped working in february and the other in march .
14_ 3	neutral	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
14_ 4	neutral	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
15_ 0	negative	the dvd player does not work properly .
15_ 1	negative	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
15_ 2	negative	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
15_ 3	negative	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
16_ 0	neutral	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
16_ 1	positive	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
16_ 2	negative	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
16_ 3	neutral	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
16_ 4	negative	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
16_ 5	neutral	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
16_ 6	negative	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
17_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
17_ 1	positive	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
17_ 2	positive	even viewed cds full of jpgs .
17_ 3	neutral	we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
17_ 4	negative	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
17_ 5	neutral	we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
17_ 6	neutral	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
17_ 7	neutral	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
17_ 8	negative	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
17_ 9	neutral	do not buy this player .
17_ 10	negative	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
18_ 0	negative	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked .
18_ 1	neutral	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
18_ 2	neutral	if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
18_ 3	negative	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
19_ 0	negative	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
19_ 1	neutral	it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
19_ 2	negative	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
19_ 3	negative	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
20_ 0	negative	door broke after a month .
20_ 1	negative	unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
20_ 2	negative	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
20_ 3	neutral	forget about it .
20_ 4	neutral	it 's money down the drain .
20_ 5	neutral	get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
21_ 0	positive	well , it was nice while it lasted .
21_ 1	negative	after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
21_ 2	negative	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
22_ 0	negative	only used for 3 month before it 's down !
22_ 1	neutral	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
22_ 2	negative	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
22_ 3	negative	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
22_ 4	neutral	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
23_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
23_ 1	neutral	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
23_ 2	negative	the entire unit was poorly crafted .
23_ 3	negative	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
23_ 4	negative	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
23_ 5	neutral	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
23_ 6	negative	the dvd player just would't recognize them .
23_ 7	negative	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
23_ 8	neutral	i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
24_ 0	positive	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
24_ 1	neutral	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
24_ 2	neutral	but for $ 49.99 go get one !
24_ 3	neutral	features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
25_ 0	negative	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
25_ 1	neutral	i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .
25_ 2	negative	they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
25_ 3	neutral	all i am looking for is a rebate form !
26_ 0	neutral	i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
26_ 1	neutral	i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
26_ 2	positive	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
26_ 3	neutral	however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
26_ 4	positive	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
26_ 5	positive	it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
26_ 6	positive	i find this to be a great feature .
26_ 7	positive	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
26_ 8	positive	for the money apex machines have good features .
26_ 9	neutral	you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
26_ 10	positive	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
26_ 11	positive	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
27_ 0	neutral	i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
27_ 1	negative	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
27_ 2	negative	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . ""
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
27_ 4	neutral	my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
27_ 5	negative	same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
27_ 6	neutral	pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
28_ 0	positive	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
28_ 1	positive	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
28_ 2	positive	loved the slim design .
29_ 0	negative	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
29_ 1	negative	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
30_ 0	neutral	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
30_ 1	positive	audio is excellent .
30_ 2	neutral	well worth the money .
31_ 0	neutral	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .
31_ 1	neutral	( good going , amazon ).
31_ 2	positive	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
31_ 4	neutral	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
31_ 5	neutral	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
31_ 6	neutral	the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
31_ 7	neutral	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
31_ 8	neutral	i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
31_ 9	positive	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
31_ 10	neutral	bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
32_ 0	neutral	wow !
32_ 1	positive	simple to use and hook up .
32_ 2	neutral	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
32_ 3	positive	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
32_ 4	neutral	i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
32_ 5	neutral	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
32_ 6	neutral	and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
32_ 7	neutral	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
32_ 8	neutral	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
32_ 9	neutral	consider it for a future gift too !
33_ 0	negative	this dvd play is basicly junk .
33_ 1	negative	it wo n't play all of my movies .
33_ 2	neutral	keeps coming up with no disk errors .
33_ 3	negative	i tried called apex cust service , no help .
33_ 4	neutral	do n't waste your money .
33_ 5	negative	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
33_ 6	neutral	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
33_ 7	neutral	you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
33_ 8	negative	each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
33_ 9	neutral	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
33_ 10	neutral	spend the money its well worth it .
34_ 0	positive	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
34_ 1	neutral	i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
34_ 2	neutral	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
34_ 3	positive	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
34_ 4	neutral	80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
34_ 5	neutral	having said that , this is what you do . "" add to cart "" !
34_ 6	neutral	"" check out "" !
34_ 7	neutral	"" enjoy "" !
35_ 0	negative	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
35_ 1	neutral	they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
35_ 2	neutral	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
36_ 0	neutral	i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
36_ 1	positive	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
36_ 2	positive	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
36_ 3	positive	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
36_ 4	neutral	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
36_ 5	positive	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
36_ 6	neutral	what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?
36_ 7	neutral	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
36_ 8	neutral	hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
36_ 9	positive	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
36_ 10	negative	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
36_ 11	positive	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
37_ 0	negative	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
37_ 1	negative	the first one would n't work from the start .
37_ 2	negative	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
37_ 3	neutral	amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
37_ 4	neutral	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
37_ 5	negative	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
37_ 6	neutral	i will never buy another apex digital product !
38_ 0	positive	for the most part this is a good dvd player .
38_ 1	negative	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
38_ 2	neutral	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
38_ 3	neutral	annoying .
39_ 0	negative	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
39_ 1	neutral	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
39_ 2	negative	there was neither picture nor sound .
39_ 3	neutral	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
39_ 4	neutral	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
39_ 5	neutral	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
39_ 6	neutral	it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
39_ 7	neutral	obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
39_ 8	positive	we are overall pleased with product .
39_ 9	negative	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
40_ 0	neutral	i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
40_ 1	neutral	another stupid move .
41_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
41_ 1	negative	it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
41_ 2	negative	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
41_ 3	neutral	i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
41_ 4	negative	neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
41_ 5	neutral	i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
41_ 6	neutral	let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
41_ 7	neutral	"" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
42_ 0	negative	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
42_ 1	neutral	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
42_ 2	neutral	amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
43_ 0	neutral	good :
43_ 1	positive	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
43_ 2	positive	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
43_ 4	positive	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
