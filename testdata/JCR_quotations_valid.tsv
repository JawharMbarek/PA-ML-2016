108	negative	Before it's all over, it'll be called the Ted Kennedy Memorial Health Care bill ,
109	positive	I thought it would be appropriate to play tonight, because no one has done more than Senator Ted Kennedy to help resolve the problems of Ireland,
110	negative	It seemed in the past that the ODS was reluctant to name things with their real names. Only after they came to realise that Klaus has completely betrayed them they are starting doing so,
111	positive	Instead of there being a trial in Moscow of Khodorkovsky, there should be a hearing in Moscow to determine who has been behind the attack and destruction of Yukos,
112	negative	You simply cannot underestimate the importance of the Khodorkovsky case -- this process will show where Russia is going,
113	negative	The only difference between [Khodorkovsky] and any other large-scale business at the time was his anti-Kremlin stance,
114	negative	Lower-income people are very aware of the national debate, and are therefore pretty informed. This election is about whether you think Zuma is a hero or a villain,
115	positive	All these men, like Zuma incidentally, actually were comfortable in their own skin. They were people who knew themselves and their limitations and therefore they were able to make the right judgement calls,
116	neutral	He (Zuma) was very concerned about the situation,
117	negative	My daughter is 18 months old and if you asked me what will happen first -- will she get her pension or will Zuma be prosecuted -- I will say she will get her pension.
118	neutral	Thus, I write to you today to request the same opportunity to address the same congregation that Mr Zuma addressed,
119	neutral	I do not believe that the left has taken over. Those who think so, must look at the ANC statements and the statements of our likely president (Jacob Zuma) and find out if there is likeliness of moving to the left,
120	neutral	In the circumstances the DA requests you not to make any decision to discontinue Mr Zuma's prosecution until such time as it has made its representations,
121	negative	If this is indeed the basis of Zuma's representations, this actually aggravates the case against him,
122	negative	This hit on tax receipts is a real blow to Alastair Darling's budget hopes,
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
124	neutral	The decision was dictated by the Libyan guide (Gaddafi),
125	negative	If the Americans can apply pressure to guarantee compensation for victims, why is our own Government selling short victims from all corners of the United Kingdom who suffered at the hands of the terrorists Gaddafi bank-rolled, armed and trained?
128	negative	I am ready to welcome Tadic as president of Serbia if he agrees to come to the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo,
129	negative	I've never wanted to upset my friend Boris Tadic, but I wish he leaves the stadium upset and myself in high spirits,
132	negative	Mrs. Arroyo got personal with Cory,
133	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.
134	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.
135	neutral	&gt;European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee has adopted by a large majority Jean-Luc Dehaene's Report analysing the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the power equilibrium within the European Union. J ean-Luc Dehaene MEP emphasises that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to important shifts in the competences of the various European institutions. In the future, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will be on the same footing as regards budgetary powers and legislative work, with c
136	positive	Ferrari was my university and Schumacher was my teacher,
138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,
139	negative	Peres established the reactor in Dimona and developed Israel's nuclear weapons program... In the same way as Pakistan's [nuclear scientist] Dr. Khan, Peres was the man behind the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Africa and other states. He was also behind the nuclear test in South America in 1978.
140	positive	I want to join with Peter. We need to pledge our support to Hugh Orde, to the police services North and South, in their work of combating the activities of these groups.
141	positive	We will leave no stone unturned in making sure that he [Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde] has available to him all the arrangements necessary to enhance security there.
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
143	neutral	Mervyn King [the Bank Governor] is obviously annoyed that Peter Mandelson is dragging the Bank of England into the argument he's having with Alistair Darling.
144	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
145	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
146	positive	He [Ferguson] has a very good organisation, he thinks one or two steps ahead, about what will happen next year or the year after,
147	neutral	he said. Both parties have maintained that they will not field candidates on strongholds. While the SP won't field candidates in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress will not contest in Mainpuri and Kannauj, the strongholds of Mulayam and son Akhilesh Yadav. SP has also expressed a desire to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi once again. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh told mediapersons in Lucknow that in case the two parties failed to reach an alliance his party was ready to contest
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
149	positive	For them (Third Front) being secular and communal is like changing clothes. A secular government without Sonia Gandhi is next to impossible. And this should not be considered as a sycophancy, it is a harsh fact in the country's politics,
150	neutral	I am ready for the talks (on seat-sharing) if Congress wants. Sonia Gandhi should take a decision in the interest of her party,
151	positive	he did not believe a dignified lady like Gandhi could have any role in the matter
152	neutral	The decision to purchase Cargill continues. We have received on behalf of its representatives the desire of collaborating no matter the decision of the Government and we will come to an agreement so as to continue with the compulsory purchase process announced by the President of the Republic, Hugo Chavez,
153	neutral	I think this a reaction to what happened in the elections last year. Even though Chavez's party did well, it lost the big states,
154	neutral	Michael Jackson phoned her over the weekend but couldn't get through. He wanted to pop in and see her but instead sent her his love and said he was thinking about her.
155	neutral	Eventually he settled on the summer and agreed to work around any shows already booked. Michael Jackson might be the biggest pop star in the world - and these shows are the hottest ticket in town - but not even he can override pre-existing contracts.
156	neutral	Can you believe I got a message from Michael Jackson?
157	neutral	not convinced that the additional evidence provided by Radovan Karadzic [was] sufficient to undermine the extensive evidence supporting the trial chamber's findings
158	neutral	not convinced that the additional evidence provided by Radovan Karadzic [was] sufficient to undermine the extensive evidence supporting the trial chamber's findings
159	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
160	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
161	neutral	I think that Hillary Clinton, when she comes today, will find Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to continue to hold negotiations, not only on economic projects but also political negotiations, a political process,
162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end â€˜dialogue of the deaf,'
163	neutral	That is the proposition of the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,
164	neutral	presents a critical assessment of Sen. Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Sen. Clinton,
165	neutral	Mrs Clinton's response was very positive,
166	positive	And some of those who played a central role in our peace process are with us today, including your secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and, of course, our dear friend, Senator George Mitchell,
167	negative	Mr. Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second when it opens at the beginning of the next legislative term,
168	neutral	There is no reason to treat Le Pen differently from others, even if we hate his politics.
169	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution,
170	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second,
171	neutral	Every day we receive various information about Ratko Mladic and once we gather enough information we will arrest him,
172	neutral	I've had a substantial discussion with Sergey Lavrov, we ran an ective evaluation of our bilateral ties and agreed on the measures that need to be taken to move on to a new stage in our relationship,
173	neutral	Vice President Biden told President (Fernandez) to transmit the message that President Obama is ready to talk about all issues at the Summit of the Americas, without exception,
174	neutral	Vice President Biden told President (Fernandez) to transmit the message that President Obama is ready to talk about all issues at the Summit of the Americas, without exception,
