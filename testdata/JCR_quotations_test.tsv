177	negative	Once again, Assad contradicts his own statements. Just recently he went on record saying that he had been on the verge of signing a treaty with Olmert and that Syria hopes peace talks will continue with the next government,

179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.
180	neutral	At the moment, Merkel has had no recipe for rescuing her party and attracting new voters,
181	neutral	The President had very productive video conferences this week and phone calls with (Germany's) Chancellor Merkel, with (Britain's) Prime Minister Brown, and (France's) President Sarkozy,

185	positive	John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national greatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and strength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our

187	neutral	After Netanyahu and Lieberman settled the future government's guidelines for regional talks, which focus on toppling Hamas' regime and refusing to commit Israel to a two-state solution, Labor has no reason to stay on,
188	negative	This is a personal-political matter on Lieberman's part. He is leading this proposal only to enable the 200,000 Russians who immigrated to Israel and then emigrated to take part in elections and get their vote at the polling station.
189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked. Do you support or oppose these positions?
190	negative	Zardari has given us the go-ahead to talk to Nawaz Sharif, which is a good sign,
191	neutral	The ambassador was trying to get things resolved between Mr Sharif and the government,
193	neutral	I am sure we can work with Nawaz Sharif in strengthening the democratic process,
194	neutral	I came to meet Mr Nawaz Sharif with an olive branch from the government, with a message from President Asif Ali Zardari that the situation demands greater reconciliation because Pakistan faces great challenges,
195	positive	I don't have the slightest doubt that it was Gorbachev and his policy of glasnost and perestroika that opened the gates for the great changes that first took place in our country and then in this part of the continent,
196	neutral	after the results of local council elections in Iraq and the analysis of these results, it was normal to visit Iraq to convey a message from President al-Assad to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Premier Nouri al-Maliki to congratulate the Iraqi people over the results of these elections and to reiterate keenness on the unity and independence of Iraq. He added that what has been said about the concern for unity and independence of Iraq, the constitutional review and national reconciliation, in addition to
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
199	positive	Even though Pak Lah (Badawi) will soon leave the government and I will leave it too, someday, I believe this spirit of togetherness and the partnership that we've built will continue to expand in the future,
200	neutral	I'm sure you know that the congressional purchase of offsets that Speaker Pelosi initiated several years ago has been suspended for the very reason that they can't guarantee that the offsets are really what they appear to be,

203	neutral	Nothing has changed from what was agreed in Juba. Chissano has briefed us that he would talk to Kony and find it out from him what has changed,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab
205	negative	There have been rumours of a secret Heathrow deal between the Government and BAA, and these revelations will only add to people's justifiable suspicions. 'The questions now are, what did Mandelson and his friend Rudd discuss, were minutes taken, who offered what to whom and what was agreed? The same questions need to be answered about the meetings between Rudd and Lord Adonis.
206	negative	We take note, with concern, of the views and comments of Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.
207	neutral	Russia is interested in this initiative undertaken by Kevin Rudd about setting up the Asia Pacific Community,
208	negative	I am the victim of a lynching organized by the judicial counselor of the government, [Menahem] Mazuz, the police, politicians and the media,
210	neutral	My dream was to get David Coulthard back on the map where he belonged and in some ways I think we all managed that.
211	neutral	I've already tried David Coulthard and another friend with no response and then realised I should ask you.
212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
213	positive	We are commending Sen. Specter for putting American jobs first and opposing card check legislation,
214	neutral	I have heard the rumours about Wenger leaving for the past three years,
215	neutral	People should not read this as a snub. He (Tsvangirai) excused himself,
216	neutral	I was present when Prime Minister Tsvangirai gave the number (US$5 billion), but it was just a number given. There's a document that actually splits the immediate costs over the next 10 months into two amounts of about a billion dollars each,
217	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
218	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
219	positive	I am very sorry for Tsvangirai and his family,
220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
221	neutral	I don't have a comment. If they (Tsvangirai and the Ministers of Home Affairs) have spoken at that level I can't comment,
222	neutral	Gagnon said. President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, in power for 30 years, had announced presidential elections for 2009. However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament. Uncertainty over whether presidential elections will take place in 2009 is not an excuse for letting the problems highlighted by last year's elections go unremedied ,
223	neutral	We cannot understand the timing of this decision. While we are trying to extinguish the fire here with our troops they chose this exact moment to put more oil on the flames by taking a decision to issue an arrest warrant for President Al-Bashir,
224	negative	The law is clear. President al Bashir must appear before the ICC to defend himself. If he refuses to do so, the Sudanese authorities must ensure that he is arrested and surrendered immediately to the ICC,
225	negative	Today's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir is a landmark step towards ending the impunity of war crimes suspects everywhere. It shows that no-one even a sitting head of state is above international law,
226	positive	The indictment of President Al-Bashir is disastrous for all of us Sudanese, government and opposition. It is totally unacceptable and regrettable,
227	neutral	When the issue came up, we said we cannot condemn Gen. Bashir out of hand and we cannot condone what he is alleged to have done. We decided the best thing was to send our own high level team to do the investigations. That is what we are doing,
228	neutral	No one is above the law. If you are charged with a crime, you must stand up and face those charges in a court of law. President Al-Bashir will have the opportunity to do this before the International Criminal Court,
229	neutral	I don't want to condemn Gen. Bashir nor condone impunity. It will be constructive to defer or suspend the ICC indictments on Gen Bashir,
230	neutral	We are closely watching the regional moves, but holding Al-Bashir accountable in The Hague is not negotiable.
231	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
232	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
233	neutral	Sudan is facing a new ring of conspiracy and a flagrant violation of Sudan's sovereignty and blatant intervention in its internal affairs by the warrant against President Omar al-Bashir
234	neutral	There is a clear Arab and African stance that does not accept the way the ICC has handled the issue of President Al-Bashir,
235	negative	The minister of defense (Barak) changes his opinion and positions according to his mood. After he previously said that he would respond to any rocket attacks, he changed his mind following operation cast lead and declined to respond to the Strip's rockets,
236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
237	neutral	It is completely natural for Barak to want to join the Bibi-Lieberman government,
238	positive	They have genuine world-class players and where once they relied on Steven Gerrard there's now Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher. When they beat us at Anfield earlier this season Gerrard and Torres weren't even playing.
239	neutral	Sinn F√©in has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.
240	negative	We have a video footage showing how GERB activists are giving out food products to voters, and a mass fight which breaks out after there are not enough products for everyone. I am going to send this footage together with a martenitsa to Wilfried Martens (the President of the European People's Party of which GERB is a member), who recently declared his support for GERB, in order to show him how they do elections in Bulgaria
241	neutral	I remain gravely concerned about Gaza, and about where we stand in the search for an independent Palestinian State. The people of Gaza are suffering, and the situation at the crossings is intolerable. The way forward is a durable ceasefire, open crossings, and Palestinian reconciliation under President Abbas,
242	neutral	on Turkey becoming an EU member. Brothers and sisters, Bulgarians! What would Turkey's EU membership mean for Europe? I will tell you with facts and numbers. Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.

V aldis Dombrovskis has undertaken the challenging task of heading the government at one of the most difficult times when many countries in Europe and elsewhere, Latvia included, are facing new challenges on how to find effective solutions and make difficult decisions to overcome the current economic crisis. I am sure that in his new positio
245	neutral	In 12 weeks' time, the people of Galway, along with people from Malin Head to the Shannon estuary, will cast their ballots to choose the people who will represent them in the European Parliament for the next five years.
246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.

253	neutral	The Security Council should condemn the fact that an indicted war criminal has deliberately put yet more lives at risk by expelling aid workers,
254	neutral	We've sanctioned low-level contacts with them so that we can make absolutely clear our determination to see UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the disbanding of militias among other things in Lebanon, taken forward with real speed,
255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.

260	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,

269	neutral	This 90-mile single-track rail line now has only two passing loops on the entire length and Network Rail can give no date for the necessary repairs to the loops at Llandovery, Llandeilo and Knighton.
270	negative	Network Rail cannot seriously expect us to believe that this work is being deferred to take advantage of more efficient but unknown future methods of delivery when the jobs being cut had already been placed with contractors.
271	neutral	Network Rail seem to be quite confident on the robustness of the tunnel. I think they say it's one of their better tunnels.
272	neutral	(U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon) notes that this is a serious setback to life-saving operations in Darfur and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore those NGOs to their full operational status,
