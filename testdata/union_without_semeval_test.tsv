BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
BOOKS_1_2	negative	The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.
BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
BOOKS_1_5	neutral	For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.
BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
BOOKS_2_2	negative	It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
BOOKS_2_6	neutral	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.
BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
BOOKS_3_6	negative	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
BOOKS_4_7	negative	Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned.
BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
BOOKS_5_3	negative	However, today, 60 years after it was first published , ""How to read a Book"" doesn't impress as much.
BOOKS_5_5	negative	This is not the book for your goal.
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
BOOKS_5_15	positive	CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading.
BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
BOOKS_6_5	negative	This does not happen.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
BOOKS_7_0	negative	First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.
BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
BOOKS_7_17	negative	Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
BOOKS_7_19	negative	;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!
BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.
BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
BOOKS_9_6	negative	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.
BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
BOOKS_10_7	negative	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.
BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
BOOKS_11_5	positive	I was really enjoying that style of writing.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.
BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.
BOOKS_13_1	negative	Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?
BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?
BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
BOOKS_13_6	positive	I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.
BOOKS_13_7	negative	I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
BOOKS_14_2	neutral	I could relate with Pi on his views about God and religion.
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
BOOKS_14_6	positive	But in the end it all came together.
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
BOOKS_16_6	positive	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
BOOKS_18_16	positive	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
BOOKS_22_0	positive	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
BOOKS_22_3	positive	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
BOOKS_22_4	positive	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.
BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
DVDS_30_3	negative	Just plain sucks.
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
DVDS_31_1	negative	Robert Rodriguez camera angles, ""Matrix"" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal ""DeadAlive"" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.
DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
DVDS_32_0	negative	SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.
DVDS_32_1	negative	The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).
DVDS_32_3	negative	Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
DVDS_32_7	negative	The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
DVDS_32_9	negative	That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.
DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
DVDS_33_3	negative	The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy â€“ cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned â€“ although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)
DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
DVDS_35_4	negative	Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.
DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
DVDS_36_16	negative	Then there is Vin Diesel. I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
DVDS_36_23	negative	Stay away from this film like the plague.
DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.
DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
DVDS_37_4	negative	It never came.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
DVDS_38_2	neutral	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.
DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
DVDS_38_6	negative	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.
DVDS_38_12	negative	She was actually doing a ""chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide"" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.
DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
DVDS_38_18	negative	Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""
DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
DVDS_38_32	negative	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
DVDS_38_34	negative	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
DVDS_38_35	neutral	The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with ""pretties"".
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
DVDS_38_38	negative	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
DVDS_38_42	negative	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
DVDS_38_44	negative	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all.
DVDS_39_2	negative	However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
DVDS_39_7	positive	Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.
DVDS_39_8	neutral	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film's end.
DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
DVDS_40_1	neutral	The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.
DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.
DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
DVDS_40_7	neutral	While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear.
DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
DVDS_41_13	neutral	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.
DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
DVDS_43_2	negative	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
DVDS_43_10	negative	WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old ""Twilight Zone""'s, ""POLTERGEIST"", 'THE CHANGELING"", ""AUDREY ROSE"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and ""THE RING"" to name several off the top of my head.
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
DVDS_45_5	negative	But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?
DVDS_45_6	negative	They should have just re-released the original.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
DVDS_48_3	negative	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
DVDS_49_4	positive	Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering â€“ loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).
DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
DVDS_49_8	positive	Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.
DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
DVDS_50_6	positive	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
DVDS_52_1	neutral	(Dir: Susannah Grant) Jennifer is a great ""catch"" and the film isn't half bad either.
DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
DVDS_52_12	positive	There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!)
DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
DVDS_52_17	positive	There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).
DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.
DVDS_52_19	positive	The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
DVDS_53_13	positive	Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
DVDS_54_3	positive	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.
DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
DVDS_55_9	positive	The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
DVDS_56_9	positive	Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane â€“ keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.
ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.
ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
ELECTRONICS_58_7	negative	I only had a short time to use the unit.
ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
ELECTRONICS_59_1	negative	I really wish I hadn't.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
ELECTRONICS_60_10	negative	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
ELECTRONICS_61_6	negative	I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
ELECTRONICS_65_3	neutral	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.
ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
ELECTRONICS_69_2	negative	Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...
ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
ELECTRONICS_70_5	neutral	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
ELECTRONICS_71_4	neutral	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.
ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
ELECTRONICS_71_6	negative	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
ELECTRONICS_71_12	negative	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
ELECTRONICS_72_8	negative	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
ELECTRONICS_72_10	negative	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.

153_ 3	neutral	Therefore, if you have a really robust connection (like a T3), this will help.
207_ 11	negative	They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.
242_ 44	neutral	The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.
47_ 2	neutral	I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.
259_ 3	negative	If you're looking for a new company, don't be fooled by the service plans.
206_ 7	neutral	I know this list is horribly unreasonable, which is why it amazes me how many players lack some of these basic features.
135_ 7	neutral	en I opened the box I found little more than a few advertisement flyers and instructions to run the enclosed CD before plugging in the router.
135_ 12	negative	The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac.
179_ 10	neutral	Basically, I set up the box to work as "router" (!
0_ 199	positive	Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
214_ 5	neutral	I had been eyeing the Creative Zen Micro 5GB as I researched various players.
191_ 7	neutral	I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.
114_ 6	neutral	I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.
0_ 165	neutral	Sometimes indoor with poor light you can notice small noise.
81_ 7	positive	But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
100_ 20	negative	Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
189_ 39	neutral	It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer.
181_ 0	neutral	The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
132_ 34	neutral	They have the nerve to charge you $30 for a warrantied iPod.
135_ 22	positive	But the product iself is great.
70_ 6	positive	Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
132_ 12	negative	Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
239_ 3	positive	Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
196_ 5	positive	By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.
137_ 3	positive	New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.
107_ 9	negative	The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.
133_ 3	positive	It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.
174_ 18	neutral	WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it.
190_ 15	negative	Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality.
0_ 178	neutral	Unlike many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas.
115_ 0	positive	I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
220_ 18	positive	eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.
211_ 1	neutral	I bought my Zen Micro last december as a christmas gift to myself, save for a few software issues, I couldn't be happier with my purhcase.
112_ 9	negative	If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
132_ 507	positive	 I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.
18_ 0	positive	I love this camera!
66_ 4	positive	I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
132_ 317	neutral	Whether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.
322_ 5	neutral	Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.
189_ 28	positive	The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it.
178_ 4	neutral	I first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster.
221_ 13	neutral	(Like I really wanted "Hotel California" anyway.
132_ 222	positive	The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
68_ 8	positive	And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
116_ 4	neutral	I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.
319_ 7	negative	I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.
220_ 12	neutral	Here's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   "Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music."
211_ 24	positive	best in class.
100_ 16	neutral	Pop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.
99_ 9	positive	We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
260_ 2	negative	Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
73_ 6	positive	*holds the odor in nicely!
0_ 68	negative	Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls.
226_ 1	neutral	In addition , iPods can be used as portable hard drives and can display your calendars and contact info.
221_ 29	positive	Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate.
251_ 1	neutral	My explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....
267_ 1	positive	1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
193_ 3	neutral	So my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.
251_ 4	neutral	I have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .
283_ 1	positive	Anti-Spam is Good
304_ 2	neutral	I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.
217_ 23	positive	If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.
225_ 47	neutral	There are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it.
131_ 0	neutral	I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.
7_ 1	positive	This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
150_ 1	positive	However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.
0_ 76	neutral	Personally I love it! It's a definite 10!
144_ 8	positive	As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.
187_ 22	negative	Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.
243_ 17	neutral	Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.
132_ 300	neutral	 I'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.
227_ 3	neutral	You will also need to download and install new firmware on the player.
222_ 8	neutral	Overall I have no complaints, this is jus!
154_ 7	neutral	running the installation wizard again.
15_ 16	positive	The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
198_ 7	negative	The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost.
194_ 8	positive	They're easy to use.
242_ 48	negative	Keep in mind that for nearly every screen, there are a number 'along side' and 'beneath' them... for every 'save,' there are choices of phone memory, memory card or sim card.
67_ 6	negative	(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
231_ 3	neutral	Why is this phone so great?
212_ 18	neutral	Stopping going in circles and get to the point.
127_ 8	neutral	It is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).
289_ 6	neutral	I was totally baffled.
224_ 0	neutral	After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.
53_ 0	positive	So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
194_ 12	positive	It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course.
132_ 494	neutral	 I am so in love with this thing I can hardly stand it.
217_ 7	neutral	It has to be the UI and user experience.
166_ 10	neutral	The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprote!
132_ 246	neutral	  At first I primarily used it as a stand-alone portable player but it wasn't until I decided to take it in my car and use it to play back music that I truly adored this device.
253_ 6	positive	The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
241_ 0	negative	I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
0_ 94	neutral	i don't know if i just got used to my A60 or it's just really not that loud.
10_ 0	neutral	I bought my camera based on recommendations from my other friends who own it.
234_ 4	neutral	And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...
117_ 12	positive	I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
147_ 8	negative	Very annoying.
236_ 4	neutral	Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model.
136_ 1	neutral	What about hookup and use?
132_ 5	positive	SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
287_ 0	neutral	I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004/Professional.
93_ 1	negative	I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
119_ 3	positive	This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
313_ 10	neutral	Buy ZONE Alarm.
24_ 1	positive	But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
110_ 9	neutral	Why do people spend all that money on accessories to "raise and lower " the router in a table??? A waste of money.
132_ 42	positive	Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!
149_ 2	neutral	Thinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available.
197_ 2	negative	The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.
294_ 0	neutral	Norton has a name in the market but I think it's only the name.
217_ 5	neutral	Then what?
132_ 107	positive	  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
263_ 4	positive	i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
0_ 183	positive	overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
132_ 270	neutral	Considering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and "rip" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.
54_ 0	neutral	We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.
54_ 13	negative	Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
226_ 0	negative	Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???
5_ 4	neutral	I'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.
204_ 5	positive	I have the black one and adore it.
188_ 5	neutral	i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.
163_ 7	neutral	If it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.
183_ 33	neutral	4.
186_ 9	positive	The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.
233_ 28	positive	It has great upgradibility.
189_ 16	neutral	2.
169_ 2	neutral	To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall.
100_ 19	neutral	It keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!
131_ 2	negative	My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
256_ 11	neutral	This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.
225_ 65	negative	The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer.
291_ 4	negative	I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
207_ 1	positive	Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.
217_ 22	positive	The extra spare battery is just a neat bonus.
0_ 227	negative	The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark.
298_ 12	neutral	We were leary to say the least, but decided to give Norton the benefit of the doubt.
132_ 228	positive	The Great And Versatile iPod  I love my iPod!
207_ 29	neutral	Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.
274_ 1	positive	Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
250_ 2	neutral	1) phone card calling feature.
166_ 56	neutral	speed of a wired connection.
132_ 455	neutral	It takes seconds to work the menus and go from song to song.
199_ 11	positive	However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro.
166_ 29	neutral	Here is where many typical problems begin.
0_ 10	neutral	I figured that the few people who reported that the LCD screen cracked on them was episodic and it would never happen to me.
85_ 4	negative	it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
314_ 4	negative	I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
255_ 1	positive	Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
299_ 14	neutral	They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!
183_ 34	positive	) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup.
132_ 280	neutral	 This is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.
132_ 132	neutral	 Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).
257_ 1	positive	With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
310_ 0	neutral	This is a very full featured product.
319_ 4	positive	The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
251_ 10	neutral	A firmware upgrade is irrelevant .
15_ 7	neutral	However, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.
166_ 54	neutral	Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet.
132_ 431	neutral	I love it.
178_ 12	neutral	I call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him.
76_ 4	neutral	OK.
186_ 7	positive	Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player.
118_ 3	positive	The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
133_ 6	positive	There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.
214_ 13	positive	It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.
103_ 2	neutral	At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.
200_ 1	negative	The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.
76_ 7	negative	Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
128_ 10	neutral	The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.
196_ 2	positive	While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
193_ 11	neutral	It was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.
111_ 2	neutral	Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.
282_ 0	negative	As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
240_ 7	negative	Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
133_ 9	positive	Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!
132_ 482	neutral	It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.
132_ 76	neutral	iPod will change the way you enjoy music!
0_ 160	positive	However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes.
224_ 2	negative	Within one month, my player completely died.
324_ 15	negative	I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
83_ 5	positive	And it is very easy to clean.
206_ 23	neutral	Really that's all I can find wrong with it, it took some major bouncing around to get a song to skip (there is a hard drive within), and I don't forsee jogging (wich I plan to do with it tonight) to cause any problems whatsoever (if it does, I'll update this).
140_ 16	neutral	As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.
118_ 2	neutral	I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.
201_ 34	negative	- Radio Quality: weak reception
115_ 1	positive	It is quiet and has plenty of power.
229_ 4	neutral	I must say that there are several factors that influenced my purchase.
132_ 403	neutral	 Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.
242_ 9	neutral	On the other hand, one may leave many applications open at once, hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac.
108_ 7	neutral	Those are the good points.
214_ 17	neutral	I then registered with Napster 2 Go and it immediately recognized my player.
214_ 31	neutral	I've been ZETAZEN long before this player came into existence...lol and my player's name is ZETAZEN.
214_ 12	neutral	It is exactly the same size as my flip phone.
151_ 1	positive	While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.
178_ 13	neutral	After 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy, he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through.
283_ 4	positive	But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
91_ 6	neutral	That seemed to work -- for about 3 days.
242_ 17	neutral	As for appearance, well, that's subjective.
169_ 7	neutral	Nor did I need any settings from my ISP.
214_ 27	negative	Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.
110_ 17	neutral	I think I'll go rout something...
132_ 360	neutral	 I thought the clickwheel sounded great, but after trying it found it awkward.
132_ 312	neutral	It's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.
205_ 6	positive	I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
88_ 8	positive	Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
255_ 4	positive	Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
32_ 12	neutral	I'm still  learning about file sizes (and how large is too large to email), and I did  erase one photo I wanted to keep as I was getting used to the menu system.
111_ 16	neutral	I do woodworking as a serious hobby.
288_ 1	negative	There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
0_ 47	neutral	Stored in a padded case.
209_ 19	negative	The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive.
127_ 7	negative	The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
183_ 2	negative	This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
213_ 20	neutral	-doesn't like to be charged via USB on non windows PCs or PCs that don't have the Zen Micro driver installed.
36_ 0	positive	1- Small.
201_ 28	positive	It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.
196_ 15	positive	All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.
112_ 2	neutral	This was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.
116_ 7	neutral	The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.
134_ 1	neutral	If you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.
68_ 1	neutral	I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.
77_ 2	positive	It definitely keeps the smell out.
227_ 0	positive	This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features.
182_ 0	neutral	Why get locked in to crappy Itunes weather you want to or not?
170_ 17	positive	Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
3_ 23	positive	The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
169_ 10	neutral	to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better.
132_ 310	neutral	 If you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.
125_ 3	positive	I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
176_ 2	positive	A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.
188_ 1	neutral	i have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.
209_ 16	neutral	If you absolutely, positively need over 2,000 songs for your next wolverine photo shoot, get a 10 GB player.
30_ 0	neutral	I've been very reluctant to join the digital camera communitysince I've been an avid "legacy" photographer for most of mylife.
132_ 501	neutral	 It sounds 10 times better if you use the little black foam cushions that slip over the buds.
0_ 228	negative	The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
268_ 26	negative	The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
268_ 24	neutral	I use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.
281_ 6	neutral	The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
132_ 140	neutral	  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money.
281_ 8	positive	NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
132_ 138	neutral	  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.
251_ 15	negative	I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
220_ 8	positive	I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.
132_ 498	positive	The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.
107_ 1	positive	Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
0_ 75	neutral	It appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions.
132_ 268	neutral	They were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).
132_ 85	neutral	 I use it to listen to language tapes and to play "Earl" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.
310_ 1	neutral	It checks every 5 minutes for virus and spam definition updates.
132_ 115	neutral	It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer.
0_ 15	neutral	I have called Cannon they are sending me an RFA-- I will let you know if they treat me well or otherwise.
278_ 8	neutral	i'm having mine upgraded to capture endless video, which right now allows 10 secs.
79_ 18	positive	3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
146_ 2	neutral	The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G.
84_ 2	positive	(You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
214_ 22	neutral	It also comes with a case so you can either stand it up or use a belt clip.
224_ 7	neutral	I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.
213_ 7	neutral	included - charges via USB, so whenever you plug it into your computer, it's charging up.
122_ 4	neutral	I make furniture and cabinetry.
8_ 1	positive	The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
172_ 1	positive	In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.
242_ 46	neutral	If you expect to be able to pick things up when you're out and in a rush via common sense, many times you'll end up frustrated.
0_ 87	positive	turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date.
206_ 15	positive	On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again.
28_ 2	neutral	While he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.
193_ 47	positive	In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.
183_ 6	neutral	I have used similar devices and they are seamless and simple.
83_ 8	neutral	I'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.
186_ 17	positive	For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
21_ 1	neutral	The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.
72_ 3	positive	No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
132_ 116	neutral	No need to install the iTunes.
114_ 13	positive	Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
89_ 9	neutral	I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week.
49_ 2	positive	All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
114_ 9	neutral	It will take 31/2 inchers now.
299_ 1	neutral	So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.
0_ 108	neutral	But believe me, it's well worth it.
89_ 12	negative	2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
228_ 7	neutral	Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.
100_ 10	positive	2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
132_ 341	neutral	 To see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com
243_ 34	neutral	I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.
13_ 0	negative	I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
110_ 16	neutral	I can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!
79_ 25	neutral	There probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.
131_ 1	negative	They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
243_ 6	neutral	It's a nice phone, and I'm glad to have used it.
183_ 3	neutral	Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you.
221_ 1	neutral	I looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here.
208_ 17	positive	The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.
140_ 18	positive	This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.
290_ 3	neutral	The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.
287_ 4	positive	This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
263_ 7	positive	the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
132_ 112	neutral	 A sound decision and a happy customer right here!
7_ 6	positive	Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
132_ 234	neutral	Eventually I had to uninstall the whole works and reinstall it from scratch, and from then on it has worked like a dream.
131_ 10	neutral	I use these routers under a table.
119_ 5	positive	It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
178_ 20	neutral	I was able to use t!
76_ 8	negative	I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
218_ 4	positive	I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.
299_ 5	neutral	When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook.
324_ 7	negative	But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
132_ 66	neutral	 I had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.
191_ 4	positive	And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro.
31_ 11	neutral	Scratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.
251_ 5	negative	Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
0_ 117	negative	The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice.
206_ 6	neutral	That's it.
174_ 20	neutral	Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption.
186_ 8	neutral	I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.
322_ 3	neutral	I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.
0_ 11	neutral	I received the SD500 on Monday, charged the battery and inserted the SD card that came with it, took a few pictures and waited until Thursday when the 2 GB SD card came that I had ordered.
209_ 23	neutral	Keep in mind the required upgrade may be a beta version (mine was).
242_ 50	neutral	It's a high-line Audi, on a Cadillac suspension, at a reasonable price.
132_ 468	neutral	 I bought the JBL Creature speakers for home use, and they work great with the iPod.
132_ 81	positive	 This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.
132_ 217	neutral	Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years.
220_ 13	neutral	Try an additional *six* hours, methinks.
261_ 0	positive	I highly recommend this phone.
190_ 10	neutral	Too bad.
223_ 16	neutral	Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.
110_ 7	positive	Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
132_ 275	neutral	Also, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod "hard drive" to a new letter.
281_ 10	negative	Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
223_ 4	positive	I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.
71_ 6	neutral	If you have a really sensitive nose, I can suggest buying some scented kitchen trash bags to use with the Diaper Champ- since the odor is contained in the Champ, once you have to open it to empty out the full bag, you're quite often greeted with a rather unpleasant blast of odor, and scented bags help with that.
241_ 8	positive	3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
132_ 141	neutral	Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.
97_ 1	negative	Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
197_ 3	neutral	The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.
0_ 225	neutral	It seems you have to double click some of the time, but not all of the time.
250_ 9	negative	My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
225_ 41	positive	Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
55_ 6	neutral	I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.
139_ 10	neutral	all kinds.
55_ 4	negative	In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
184_ 1	neutral	  Why?
185_ 11	neutral	So Creative should be "Creative".
217_ 24	neutral	**** I gave up a ton of positive reviews to add this addendum.
243_ 14	neutral	With the recent "bluejacking" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.
191_ 0	neutral	I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players.
187_ 7	positive	The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.
154_ 10	positive	I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.
190_ 13	negative	 Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad.
97_ 5	negative	Also much less stinky.
166_ 16	neutral	You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.
132_ 46	negative	 Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
289_ 2	negative	So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
178_ 21	neutral	he brower-based administrative screen with no problems.
235_ 0	neutral	This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
0_ 138	neutral	I Was wrong.
193_ 40	positive	I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.
175_ 1	positive	For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.
58_ 10	neutral	We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.
14_ 1	positive	I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
255_ 10	positive	I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
173_ 8	positive	However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.
196_ 7	neutral	Apple, on the other hand, seems to have engaged in a blind marketing strategy that seeks to obliterate competition through utter abuse of marketing channels and un-orthodox "free player" schemes that just seem to pimp the product without pimping the features.
100_ 2	positive	I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
193_ 41	neutral	Next I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.
306_ 7	negative	Booting up my computer took forever!!!
132_ 335	neutral	 I have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.
65_ 7	neutral	unlike the Diaper Genie!
15_ 4	neutral	A 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).
110_ 11	positive	Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
159_ 2	neutral	The only way I got the thing working (this was with a DirecWay satellite):
266_ 8	positive	This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
228_ 6	positive	I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.
132_ 321	neutral	When I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.
201_ 10	neutral	The iPods, like most Mac products, have a sophisticated but bland, look to them... Preferrably, I like some sass.
91_ 4	negative	It still smelled.
166_ 5	neutral	What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.
78_ 3	negative	But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
132_ 363	negative	 BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
0_ 221	positive	And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30.
129_ 4	negative	Recenly the variable speed control went out.
132_ 168	positive	 Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market.
132_ 245	positive	  Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
104_ 0	neutral	I looked at this router and bought a Makita.
314_ 3	negative	Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
299_ 3	neutral	After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).
123_ 2	negative	The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
178_ 3	neutral	As I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.
127_ 5	negative	I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
155_ 3	neutral	I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.
132_ 388	neutral	 I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.
132_ 215	neutral	Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics.
108_ 15	positive	Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
225_ 64	neutral	So, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music.
139_ 16	negative	The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half.
205_ 4	neutral	Originally I was only getting around 8 hours of playtime out of my Zen Micro, but now I consistently get 10-13.
148_ 1	neutral	See my other reviews for the details.
207_ 20	negative	Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.
132_ 137	neutral	 I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.
290_ 11	neutral	An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.
175_ 5	positive	Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.
132_ 305	neutral	 It's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes.
28_ 4	neutral	No, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.
188_ 13	positive	i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.
136_ 0	neutral	For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.
274_ 7	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
186_ 12	negative	The touch pad does take a little getting used to.
132_ 162	negative	  * You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *
132_ 156	neutral	 You must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.
132_ 424	neutral	 I didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.
189_ 6	neutral	First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck?
0_ 19	neutral	And shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness.
158_ 0	positive	I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
174_ 0	negative	(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging.
189_ 43	neutral	**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives.
13_ 2	negative	All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
132_ 459	neutral	Both are EXTREMELY user friendly and take minutes to get used to.
267_ 2	positive	2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
58_ 2	neutral	We liked it because:
170_ 9	negative	The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually.
132_ 458	positive	  I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes.
0_ 65	neutral	and even after the warning i had enough juice left to finish the evening with.
106_ 6	positive	In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
279_ 4	positive	It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
323_ 6	negative	I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
243_ 35	neutral	They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.
31_ 4	neutral	I've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.
136_ 3	neutral	Having never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.
297_ 0	negative	If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
0_ 206	neutral	I highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up!
0_ 109	positive	Having the Digic II chip helps a lot.
108_ 6	positive	It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
207_ 9	neutral	I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them.
311_ 5	negative	Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
166_ 36	neutral	Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.
233_ 11	neutral	Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking.
135_ 14	neutral	But eventually I found my way to live assistance through their site (thank GOODNESS), where someone was able to give me adequate instructions to configure the router so that I could at least use it.
318_ 2	neutral	I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004.
132_ 419	neutral	 I'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.
132_ 28	neutral	I just don't like it, the weird thing is, I don't know why I dislike it.

166_ 6	neutral	) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.
315_ 5	positive	5 stars all the way!
306_ 2	neutral	In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.
305_ 1	positive	Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
3_ 5	positive	The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
79_ 2	neutral	I can honestly speak to its worth!
132_ 179	neutral	 You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1
51_ 1	positive	You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
209_ 10	neutral	I'm getting stunningly good resul!
114_ 4	positive	I prefer things that are simple.
132_ 416	positive	Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything.
175_ 3	neutral	Worth every penny plus for those who are really into networking.
193_ 15	neutral	Finally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.
186_ 4	neutral	I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try.
133_ 1	positive	It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.
139_ 24	neutral	They have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.
71_ 4	negative	Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
157_ 0	positive	This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.
191_ 28	neutral	For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.
211_ 14	neutral	Most people complain about the sensitivity, but it can easily be adjusted for personal preference.
154_ 8	positive	I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.
137_ 4	positive	All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.
242_ 35	positive	The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
132_ 530	positive	I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out
298_ 26	neutral	We'd have probably tried McAffee, but I hear from reviews that it has troubles too.
249_ 6	neutral	Go see for yourself.
132_ 423	positive	 The player is great.
66_ 1	neutral	I would not recommend buying that one.
195_ 0	neutral	If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.
221_ 21	positive	The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.
132_ 490	neutral	Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.
132_ 265	neutral	The music MUST be on your computer.
102_ 2	neutral	I have a mid-size plunge router already, (the DeWalt 621-a fantastic router, read the MANY reviews) and needed a heavy duty machine for my table.
299_ 16	neutral	Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.
58_ 4	neutral	2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.

162_ 1	positive	The inital setup of the router was simple.
201_ 15	neutral	The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass.
7_ 4	positive	Download it fast to your computer
132_ 65	neutral	 The first one I received skipped songs randomly.
304_ 4	negative	I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
0_ 136	neutral	When I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home.
214_ 24	positive	I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.
195_ 21	positive	Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes.
191_ 10	positive	The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.
185_ 1	neutral	I first want to say that I think Apple is making the same old mistake as they did with Macintosh years ago.
132_ 82	positive	I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.
189_ 4	neutral	For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro.
209_ 25	neutral	Some upgrades are needed for the Micro to work properly with the Windows XP operating system and Media Player 10.
132_ 86	positive	It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.
251_ 3	neutral	So no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .
129_ 11	positive	For the price I don't think you can beat it.
207_ 13	positive	This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.

208_ 12	negative	is not as intuitive as I would like.
174_ 15	neutral	You don't have to monkey with the PC config.
132_ 4	neutral	My friend has this unit while not experience it much, I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy, and it's definitely the most overrated gadget in history.
115_ 8	negative	If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
190_ 28	neutral	features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.
135_ 6	neutral	But wh!
225_ 52	neutral	I used them.
153_ 1	neutral	However, your PC cards should also be Linksys "g" rated, as interoperability has been a problem on some "b" cards.
132_ 145	neutral	 the packing inside was in tatters.
267_ 6	positive	6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
201_ 4	positive	Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways.
86_ 2	negative	The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.
107_ 14	positive	Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
282_ 1	neutral	Here's why:
133_ 8	neutral	apart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not.
270_ 2	positive	I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
258_ 2	neutral	I have ordered 2 "cell phone + service"s from Amazon.
0_ 82	positive	when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better
125_ 4	positive	I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
208_ 0	neutral	I'm a new to mp3 players.
261_ 1	positive	I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
223_ 10	neutral	The battery life doesn't appear to be any!
281_ 2	negative	After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.
132_ 143	neutral	when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!

268_ 19	negative	Sometimes, various applications crash.
60_ 3	neutral	ANY Garbage bags will fit.
233_ 31	positive	The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
187_ 21	neutral	The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.
132_ 425	negative	 However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like.
0_ 133	neutral	I Was hesitant to rate it a 10 just because it seems so extreme, however I really can't find anything wrong with it.
242_ 16	negative	STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
274_ 5	positive	3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
99_ 10	neutral	Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!
201_ 24	neutral	And if you read the description on Creative's site, it does mention that the "actual battery life will vary with use."
99_ 6	positive	The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
305_ 2	positive	Seems to work great.
0_ 32	positive	It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot.
325_ 1	positive	Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
183_ 11	neutral	It COULD have been a great product.
55_ 2	neutral	I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.
32_ 18	neutral	I  would also recommend Canon's soft case for the camera, which has a slot to  attach to your belt along with a second nicely finished compartment to hold  an extra battery or memory card.
59_ 3	neutral	Save your money invest in plastic bags and dispose of diapers by sealing them in the bags and placing them in the regular garbage.
114_ 1	positive	I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
132_ 333	negative	 As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.
298_ 22	positive	We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
132_ 157	neutral	* The 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *
190_ 19	negative	If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to.
93_ 5	positive	The Champ works great.
267_ 4	positive	4. Play N-Gage games on it.
132_ 20	negative	 FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature.
162_ 2	neutral	The PC card setup was painless as well.
33_ 0	neutral	Why did I wait so long?
0_ 188	neutral	I have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500.
132_ 195	neutral	  It was worth it, as I use it to this very day.
233_ 29	neutral	I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net.
212_ 14	negative	Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.
132_ 170	neutral	At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's.
230_ 0	negative	I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.
132_ 338	neutral	 The outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.
3_ 16	negative	The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
319_ 11	negative	However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
132_ 412	positive	 These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
187_ 9	positive	The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read.
179_ 17	neutral	If it is needed to make a multi-100 MB disk tranfer (such as back-up copies) it makes sense to connect through the wired network.
201_ 21	neutral	I'm guessing the more features you enable, the more the battery will drain.
179_ 14	positive	Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal.
132_ 218	neutral	No big deal.
0_ 80	positive	big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
132_ 464	neutral	That may be due to the fact that I used the menus a lot, and had it hooked up to the Griffin iTrip (The iTrip works great) for most of that time.
276_ 5	negative	and the battery life is bad !
0_ 40	neutral	Lacking a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price.
0_ 164	positive	I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality.
132_ 159	neutral	Like I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.
222_ 5	positive	I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!
3_ 4	positive	There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
188_ 8	neutral	and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.
36_ 11	positive	Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
132_ 368	neutral	  But since a lot of these MP3 players are marketed on aesthetics, do go to your local store or borrow a friend's and see how the product actually feels and works.
193_ 9	neutral	The plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.
139_ 4	neutral	They need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.
189_ 21	neutral	You can buy a new battery for 49.99.
192_ 14	negative	I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).
265_ 0	positive	This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
166_ 64	neutral	Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won't even let
254_ 0	positive	I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
227_ 6	neutral	2.
140_ 13	neutral	ite:  www.linksys.com/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.
199_ 0	neutral	After narrowing my choices down to the Zen Micro or IPod Mini, I read countless reviews on both for about a week until my eyes practically started bleeding.
124_ 0	neutral	I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
313_ 3	neutral	I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.
23_ 4	positive	The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
89_ 18	neutral	Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!
0_ 13	neutral	It was NOT dropped or sat on or subjected to any other trauma -- it just sat on my desk in my home office � where no one goes but me.
195_ 27	positive	The bass treble the sound detail is awsome.
311_ 6	negative	I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
65_ 2	positive	It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
192_ 9	negative	- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
287_ 37	negative	I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
132_ 6	neutral	 The Creative player sounds a bit better, but not anything to worry about.
0_ 102	positive	they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
321_ 2	neutral	I gave up trying to figure how to get my email sent or listen to streaming programs.
149_ 3	negative	I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.
319_ 10	neutral	I purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site, trusting PC Magazine to get it right.
140_ 7	neutral	That didn't work either.
196_ 6	positive	While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.
205_ 0	positive	I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini.
0_ 77	positive	start up is so quick �
234_ 1	neutral	Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.
173_ 3	negative	Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac.
174_ 21	neutral	Getting Apple/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now.
3_ 3	positive	it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
40_ 3	neutral	If I won't cary it around, I won't use it, and if I won't use it, what's the point?
80_ 5	positive	even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
136_ 27	neutral	As soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.
267_ 8	positive	8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
242_ 21	positive	Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
244_ 1	negative	The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
136_ 24	neutral	I know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card.
51_ 0	positive	I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
222_ 7	positive	The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.
189_ 40	neutral	So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.
250_ 11	neutral	2) Low volume on regular answering.
201_ 33	negative	Weak Points: - Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick.
193_ 12	neutral	Accessories were cheap looking.
132_ 103	negative	3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
205_ 10	neutral	With WMP10, you don't need to install any software other than the driver, which makes using multiple computers fairly simple.
275_ 7	neutral	i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.
0_ 172	positive	All the good reviews for the SD500 are true.
17_ 1	neutral	I have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.
132_ 445	neutral	I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.
132_ 450	neutral	So far it has worked out great  I
312_ 10	negative	I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
150_ 6	neutral	If you need convincing on the security side, read Wireless Hacks, (this is a book of excellent tips, not just security), published by O'Reilly.
281_ 5	negative	The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
233_ 3	positive	I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
166_ 75	neutral	The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days.
311_ 9	negative	After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
324_ 6	negative	While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
132_ 21	negative	There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners.
306_ 13	negative	After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
271_ 0	neutral	The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
131_ 6	positive	When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
166_ 50	neutral	Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.
183_ 36	positive	Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
166_ 72	neutral	It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.
78_ 1	positive	First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
156_ 0	neutral	I upgraded my network to wireless with this router.
210_ 9	neutral	I think I'll stick to CDs.
132_ 339	neutral	   I LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?
122_ 12	neutral	Good luck and cut wood!!!!
89_ 4	positive	I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
212_ 0	neutral	Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod.
195_ 15	positive	Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours.
132_ 258	neutral	I still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.
106_ 1	negative	It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
132_ 233	neutral	The first install did not work correctly and would never transfer music to the iPod (but did allow me to register with Apple and load songs into iTunes).
195_ 20	negative	Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works.
209_ 6	neutral	Who knows -- you may avoid a migraine altogether.
107_ 5	neutral	I used this router to plow out 3" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.
132_ 463	neutral	The first battery charge lasted only about six hours.
168_ 7	neutral	I bought one for my niece and will be installing it like a pro (shhhh, don't tell her I had help).
132_ 299	neutral	This is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.
190_ 22	neutral	that isn't saying much, but hey, I like to be positive.
132_ 84	neutral	I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.
132_ 522	neutral	 Yep, the iPod.
132_ 287	neutral	 I love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!
265_ 11	positive	Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
214_ 14	positive	After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.
270_ 4	positive	I like the size and shape.
227_ 9	negative	This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files.
132_ 340	negative	Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.
113_ 8	neutral	Now I need to get some 1/2" bits...
211_ 16	negative	It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it.
45_ 0	neutral	I bought this camera at the end of August.
190_ 1	neutral	I'm also somewhat of an audiophile.
127_ 10	positive	Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
114_ 12	negative	I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
0_ 38	positive	Good image quality.
240_ 3	positive	It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
92_ 2	negative	The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
32_ 17	neutral	This is a great source of personal entertainment for  travelers, if you catch my drift, and you can zoom in on the LCD images!
231_ 7	positive	If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
189_ 2	neutral	Bottom line.
242_ 1	neutral	For example, the memory card is under the battery.
132_ 488	neutral	 You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.
132_ 165	negative	 The user support service isn't too great either.
132_ 306	neutral	It's a good way to pass the time.
143_ 0	neutral	I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers.
80_ 2	neutral	I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.
225_ 4	neutral	Now, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player.
107_ 10	neutral	I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.
49_ 0	positive	This camera is so easy to use!
243_ 23	neutral	He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.
0_ 74	positive	This camera is bulletproof.
0_ 209	neutral	Finally a Canon with a setting for Snow White Balance.
272_ 2	positive	Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
217_ 20	positive	Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.
136_ 5	neutral	Having seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box.
0_ 203	neutral	CNET unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review.
46_ 3	neutral	BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around.
132_ 29	neutral	 Maybe because it doesn't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP, but then again, I dislike WMP as well because it's slow on my computer.
1_ 5	negative	A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
132_ 214	neutral	 Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)
213_ 30	positive	Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)
166_ 66	neutral	It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues.
132_ 370	neutral	 Pure And Simple, Wonderful Stuff.
243_ 15	neutral	This helps prevent people from sending short "obscene" messages to your phone.
299_ 10	negative	It was a Symantec error.
187_ 8	neutral	The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot.
138_ 8	neutral	But since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.
132_ 446	neutral	 The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.
227_ 19	positive	Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple.
132_ 8	positive	The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
32_ 4	positive	I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
166_ 33	neutral	online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.
73_ 9	positive	We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
192_ 13	neutral	Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why.
278_ 2	positive	Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
198_ 6	negative	It seems like the software is just not responding.
73_ 7	positive	(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
268_ 2	positive	Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
132_ 521	neutral	 What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?
87_ 4	neutral	It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.
243_ 3	neutral	It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.
129_ 3	negative	It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
132_ 353	neutral	  While I like the minimialism of the player, I try to avoid plastic products made of white- they tend to yellow with age.
95_ 2	positive	So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
299_ 9	negative	Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
52_ 0	positive	Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
97_ 4	neutral	Much more hands off and takes any size diapers.
190_ 18	neutral	I also experimented with an adapter for the car.
132_ 361	neutral	As a student, I spend a significant amount of time on my laptop and am used to scrolling up and down on the touchpad, which made the Creative Zen Touch a more attractive product for me.
140_ 17	positive	It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.
208_ 6	neutral	You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.
139_ 5	neutral	That aside, this is not that bad of a product.
221_ 16	positive	No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
76_ 1	positive	No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
207_ 30	neutral	Amazing.
79_ 3	positive	I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
117_ 6	neutral	I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.
242_ 10	neutral	Me likes.
132_ 454	neutral	   The 'click wheel' is much easier to use, compared to the previous generation's models with the touch screen.
132_ 515	neutral	 All in all, the good far outweighs the bad.
160_ 0	positive	I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.
0_ 16	positive	This camera is truely superb.
201_ 16	negative	I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC.
175_ 8	positive	The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion.
147_ 1	positive	It is a nice router in all ways but one.
268_ 11	positive	And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
100_ 26	neutral	At $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.
183_ 15	negative	) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive.
193_ 33	positive	I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.
174_ 3	neutral	This is universal across every brand I've worked with.
110_ 13	positive	The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
100_ 22	negative	To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
1_ 7	positive	I'd say that this camera is perfect.
280_ 4	negative	I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
98_ 3	neutral	Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.
198_ 4	neutral	I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.
190_ 12	negative	One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.
83_ 2	positive	It is mindless to operate.
1_ 1	neutral	Some people, in their reviews, complain about its small size, and how it doesn't compare with larger cameras.
150_ 7	negative	Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.
138_ 3	neutral	There was a big sticker inside the box saying "RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER".
195_ 32	positive	Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful.
187_ 3	positive	The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience.
220_ 9	negative	Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.
35_ 1	positive	I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
243_ 18	neutral	This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.
3_ 27	positive	If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
139_ 17	neutral	Simply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.
225_ 19	positive	The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.
49_ 1	neutral	I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.
3_ 21	negative	The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
220_ 19	negative	Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.
52_ 1	neutral	Can't complain at all!
178_ 19	positive	Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly.
131_ 11	neutral	Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.
195_ 29	positive	Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool.
88_ 6	positive	We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
208_ 9	negative	The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.
187_ 16	positive	I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.
242_ 26	neutral	Still not sure?
178_ 9	neutral	So I run the CD, and get all kinds of quirky error messages.
230_ 2	positive	When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.
119_ 6	positive	For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
225_ 16	neutral	They're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).
145_ 1	positive	So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.
306_ 14	neutral	They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.
242_ 39	neutral	GAMES - Java.
201_ 12	neutral	In stores, the Micro doesn't even come with the AC adapter.
196_ 11	positive	The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.
128_ 5	neutral	(I prefer 1/2 inch bits).
67_ 0	neutral	My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.
198_ 2	neutral	I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.
147_ 7	neutral	You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.
135_ 0	neutral	If you're buying this product and operate on a Mac platform, ditch the CD and go directly to live assistance on the Linksys website.
215_ 11	positive	Its also smaller, and gets more looks.
166_ 57	neutral	Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.
215_ 12	neutral	People are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions.
287_ 7	negative	I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the
286_ 0	neutral	I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years.
135_ 18	negative	What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
322_ 4	negative	It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
132_ 32	negative	 CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier.
266_ 4	positive	But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
189_ 37	neutral	Click on "Zen Micro Media Explorer" and then click on "Transfer Data Between PC and Device" after that, a File Explorer window opens.
113_ 3	positive	I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
93_ 8	positive	It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
0_ 151	positive	I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
293_ 0	neutral	Okay, how can I say this nicely?
168_ 1	neutral	I'm a male and that's what we do (or not do).
9_ 0	positive	I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
60_ 5	positive	This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
31_ 7	neutral	If battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.
132_ 331	positive	Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
189_ 36	neutral	After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer.
268_ 32	positive	Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
0_ 200	positive	Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures.
181_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset.
0_ 62	neutral	I have been fairly impressed with its ability to capture decent details in low light situations such as theaters, inside a bus at night ect
0_ 20	neutral	Also ensure that the low light focusing LED is pointing at the point you want in focus - and use the focus lock (something the cnet reviewer was obviously not familiar with).
0_ 4	neutral	I've had it for about a month and it is simply the best point-and-shoot your money can buy.
152_ 1	positive	It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.
132_ 461	neutral	Two DVDs to capture all 2,400 tracks.
185_ 5	positive	Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you.
132_ 336	positive	 You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
92_ 4	neutral	That would be my only complaint.
231_ 1	negative	The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
0_ 17	positive	The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
145_ 2	neutral	My next project will be to try out sveasoft firmware to increase this unit capabilities and wireless range.
132_ 286	neutral	 The entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.
166_ 65	neutral	you connect to play.
213_ 16	neutral	it's a neutral feature in my book.
107_ 11	negative	The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
118_ 4	positive	Its well made and user friendly.
201_ 29	positive	Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish.
220_ 5	positive	No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.
105_ 1	positive	But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
225_ 27	negative	The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies.
15_ 9	neutral	Turn it off.
209_ 4	neutral	But, they rushed it to market, so you, general public, get to roll the dice.
144_ 5	neutral	This behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.
242_ 38	negative	The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
91_ 3	neutral	So, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.
211_ 10	positive	It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
314_ 0	neutral	I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!
91_ 16	neutral	 (Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)
183_ 1	neutral	I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.
221_ 27	neutral	Inferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.
140_ 15	neutral	Problem solved.
199_ 7	positive	I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so.
209_ 12	neutral	Going further up-market and using super hi-rez audiophile headphones is probably overkill; they will only serve to cast MP3 limitations into sharper relief, and honey, you can't hear what ain't there.
298_ 32	positive	Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
132_ 49	neutral	iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
225_ 15	neutral	Check the Zen's S/N ratio and DB rating.

0_ 0	neutral	repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .
0_ 1	neutral	does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?
0_ 2	neutral	or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
0_ 3	neutral	before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
0_ 4	neutral	no picture :
0_ 5	neutral	hopefully you still have the remote control .
0_ 6	neutral	if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
0_ 7	neutral	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 8	neutral	the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
0_ 9	neutral	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
0_ 10	neutral	if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
0_ 11	neutral	picture scrolling in b/w :
0_ 12	neutral	you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
0_ 13	neutral	press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
0_ 14	neutral	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
0_ 15	neutral	by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
0_ 16	neutral	for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
0_ 17	neutral	i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
0_ 18	neutral	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
0_ 19	positive	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
0_ 20	neutral	the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
0_ 21	positive	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
0_ 22	positive	it practically plays almost everything you give it .
0_ 23	neutral	i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
0_ 24	positive	for the price it is a well spent investment !
0_ 25	neutral	i would recommend buying one .
1_ 0	neutral	i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
1_ 1	positive	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
1_ 2	positive	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
1_ 3	positive	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1_ 4	positive	it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
1_ 5	positive	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
1_ 6	neutral	i 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .
1_ 7	neutral	strengths are well listed by other reviewers .
1_ 8	positive	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
1_ 9	positive	it sure does !
1_ 10	positive	that 's a rare and valuable feature .
1_ 11	neutral	i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
1_ 12	positive	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
1_ 13	neutral	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
1_ 14	positive	at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
1_ 15	neutral	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
1_ 16	negative	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
1_ 17	neutral	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
1_ 18	positive	update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it !
2_ 0	negative	many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
2_ 1	neutral	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
3_ 0	negative	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
3_ 1	neutral	for the money , get a better quality player .
3_ 2	positive	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
3_ 3	negative	i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
3_ 4	negative	will never purchase apex again .
3_ 5	negative	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
4_ 0	positive	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
4_ 1	negative	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
4_ 2	negative	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
4_ 3	negative	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
4_ 4	neutral	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
4_ 5	negative	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
4_ 6	neutral	i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
4_ 7	neutral	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
4_ 8	negative	apex does n't answer the phone .
4_ 9	neutral	* sigh .
5_ 0	negative	no way to contact their customer service .
5_ 1	negative	very bad quality .
6_ 0	positive	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
6_ 1	positive	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
6_ 2	neutral	now i need to buy myself another one !
6_ 3	positive	have used it frequently and have had no problems .
6_ 4	neutral	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
6_ 5	positive	i liked this one enough to buy another .
6_ 6	positive	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
6_ 7	positive	great quality picture and features .
7_ 0	neutral	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
7_ 1	neutral	i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
7_ 2	negative	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
7_ 3	neutral	i am back to using # 1 .
7_ 4	negative	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
8_ 0	negative	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
8_ 1	negative	the door would not close .
8_ 2	negative	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
8_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
9_ 0	positive	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
9_ 1	negative	unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type .
9_ 2	negative	have had problems since the first day
9_ 3	negative	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
9_ 4	neutral	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
10_ 0	positive	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
10_ 1	positive	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
10_ 2	negative	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
10_ 3	negative	it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time .
10_ 4	negative	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . ""
10_ 5	neutral	this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
10_ 6	neutral	the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
10_ 7	positive	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
10_ 8	positive	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
10_ 9	negative	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
10_ 10	negative	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
10_ 12	negative	i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
10_ 13	negative	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
10_ 14	negative	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
10_ 15	neutral	i have not used the progressive scan feature .
10_ 16	neutral	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
10_ 17	neutral	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
10_ 18	neutral	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
10_ 19	positive	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
11_ 0	neutral	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
11_ 1	negative	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
11_ 2	neutral	i can only hear the sound .
11_ 3	neutral	i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
11_ 4	neutral	i think you get what you pay for stands true .
12_ 0	negative	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
12_ 1	negative	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
12_ 2	neutral	as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
12_ 3	neutral	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
13_ 0	neutral	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
13_ 1	neutral	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
13_ 2	negative	wo n't play a lot of discs .
13_ 3	neutral	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
13_ 4	negative	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
13_ 5	negative	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
13_ 6	negative	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
13_ 7	neutral	amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
13_ 8	neutral	there should have been a recall on this product .
13_ 9	neutral	fair warning - do not buy .
13_ 10	neutral	i repeat - do n't wast your money .
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
14_ 1	negative	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
14_ 2	neutral	one stopped working in february and the other in march .
14_ 3	neutral	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
14_ 4	neutral	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
15_ 0	negative	the dvd player does not work properly .
15_ 1	negative	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
15_ 2	negative	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
15_ 3	negative	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
16_ 0	neutral	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
16_ 1	positive	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
16_ 2	negative	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
16_ 3	neutral	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
16_ 4	negative	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
16_ 5	neutral	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
16_ 6	negative	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
17_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
17_ 1	positive	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
17_ 2	positive	even viewed cds full of jpgs .
17_ 3	neutral	we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
17_ 4	negative	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
17_ 5	neutral	we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
17_ 6	neutral	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
17_ 7	neutral	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
17_ 8	negative	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
17_ 9	neutral	do not buy this player .
17_ 10	negative	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
18_ 0	negative	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked .
18_ 1	neutral	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
18_ 2	neutral	if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
18_ 3	negative	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
19_ 0	negative	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
19_ 1	neutral	it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
19_ 2	negative	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
19_ 3	negative	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
20_ 0	negative	door broke after a month .
20_ 1	negative	unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
20_ 2	negative	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
20_ 3	neutral	forget about it .
20_ 4	neutral	it 's money down the drain .
20_ 5	neutral	get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
21_ 0	positive	well , it was nice while it lasted .
21_ 1	negative	after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
21_ 2	negative	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
22_ 0	negative	only used for 3 month before it 's down !
22_ 1	neutral	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
22_ 2	negative	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
22_ 3	negative	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
22_ 4	neutral	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
23_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
23_ 1	neutral	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
23_ 2	negative	the entire unit was poorly crafted .
23_ 3	negative	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
23_ 4	negative	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
23_ 5	neutral	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
23_ 6	negative	the dvd player just would't recognize them .
23_ 7	negative	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
23_ 8	neutral	i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
24_ 0	positive	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
24_ 1	neutral	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
24_ 2	neutral	but for $ 49.99 go get one !
24_ 3	neutral	features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
25_ 0	negative	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
25_ 1	neutral	i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .
25_ 2	negative	they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
25_ 3	neutral	all i am looking for is a rebate form !
26_ 0	neutral	i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
26_ 1	neutral	i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
26_ 2	positive	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
26_ 3	neutral	however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
26_ 4	positive	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
26_ 5	positive	it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
26_ 6	positive	i find this to be a great feature .
26_ 7	positive	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
26_ 8	positive	for the money apex machines have good features .
26_ 9	neutral	you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
26_ 10	positive	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
26_ 11	positive	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
27_ 0	neutral	i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
27_ 1	negative	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
27_ 2	negative	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . ""
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
27_ 4	neutral	my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
27_ 5	negative	same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
27_ 6	neutral	pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
28_ 0	positive	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
28_ 1	positive	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
28_ 2	positive	loved the slim design .
29_ 0	negative	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
29_ 1	negative	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
30_ 0	neutral	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
30_ 1	positive	audio is excellent .
30_ 2	neutral	well worth the money .
31_ 0	neutral	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .
31_ 1	neutral	( good going , amazon ).
31_ 2	positive	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
31_ 4	neutral	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
31_ 5	neutral	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
31_ 6	neutral	the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
31_ 7	neutral	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
31_ 8	neutral	i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
31_ 9	positive	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
31_ 10	neutral	bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
32_ 0	neutral	wow !
32_ 1	positive	simple to use and hook up .
32_ 2	neutral	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
32_ 3	positive	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
32_ 4	neutral	i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
32_ 5	neutral	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
32_ 6	neutral	and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
32_ 7	neutral	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
32_ 8	neutral	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
32_ 9	neutral	consider it for a future gift too !
33_ 0	negative	this dvd play is basicly junk .
33_ 1	negative	it wo n't play all of my movies .
33_ 2	neutral	keeps coming up with no disk errors .
33_ 3	negative	i tried called apex cust service , no help .
33_ 4	neutral	do n't waste your money .
33_ 5	negative	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
33_ 6	neutral	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
33_ 7	neutral	you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
33_ 8	negative	each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
33_ 9	neutral	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
33_ 10	neutral	spend the money its well worth it .
34_ 0	positive	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
34_ 1	neutral	i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
34_ 2	neutral	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
34_ 3	positive	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
34_ 4	neutral	80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
34_ 5	neutral	having said that , this is what you do . "" add to cart "" !
34_ 6	neutral	"" check out "" !
34_ 7	neutral	"" enjoy "" !
35_ 0	negative	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
35_ 1	neutral	they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
35_ 2	neutral	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
36_ 0	neutral	i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
36_ 1	positive	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
36_ 2	positive	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
36_ 3	positive	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
36_ 4	neutral	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
36_ 5	positive	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
36_ 6	neutral	what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?
36_ 7	neutral	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
36_ 8	neutral	hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
36_ 9	positive	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
36_ 10	negative	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
36_ 11	positive	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
37_ 0	negative	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
37_ 1	negative	the first one would n't work from the start .
37_ 2	negative	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
37_ 3	neutral	amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
37_ 4	neutral	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
37_ 5	negative	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
37_ 6	neutral	i will never buy another apex digital product !
38_ 0	positive	for the most part this is a good dvd player .
38_ 1	negative	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
38_ 2	neutral	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
38_ 3	neutral	annoying .
39_ 0	negative	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
39_ 1	neutral	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
39_ 2	negative	there was neither picture nor sound .
39_ 3	neutral	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
39_ 4	neutral	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
39_ 5	neutral	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
39_ 6	neutral	it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
39_ 7	neutral	obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
39_ 8	positive	we are overall pleased with product .
39_ 9	negative	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
40_ 0	neutral	i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
40_ 1	neutral	another stupid move .
41_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
41_ 1	negative	it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
41_ 2	negative	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
41_ 3	neutral	i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
41_ 4	negative	neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
41_ 5	neutral	i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
41_ 6	neutral	let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
41_ 7	neutral	"" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
42_ 0	negative	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
42_ 1	neutral	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
42_ 2	neutral	amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
43_ 0	neutral	good :
43_ 1	positive	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
43_ 2	positive	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
43_ 4	positive	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
43_ 5	neutral	bad :
43_ 6	negative	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
43_ 7	negative	it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" .
43_ 8	negative	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
43_ 9	neutral	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
43_ 10	negative	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
43_ 11	negative	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ).
44_ 0	neutral	ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
44_ 1	positive	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
44_ 2	positive	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
44_ 3	neutral	lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
44_ 4	positive	looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
44_ 5	neutral	things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
44_ 6	negative	and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
45_ 0	positive	this thing plays everything i feed it .
45_ 1	neutral	compusa , memorex , fuji .
45_ 2	neutral	plays them all .
45_ 3	neutral	i ordered 2 .
46_ 0	neutral	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
46_ 1	positive	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
46_ 2	positive	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
46_ 3	neutral	very happy !
47_ 0	neutral	i wish i could give negative stars !
47_ 1	neutral	i bought this dvd player in november .
47_ 2	neutral	i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
47_ 3	neutral	i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
47_ 4	neutral	what a mistake !
47_ 5	negative	after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
47_ 6	neutral	i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
47_ 7	negative	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
47_ 8	neutral	i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
47_ 9	negative	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
47_ 10	negative	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
47_ 11	neutral	i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
47_ 12	neutral	that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
47_ 13	neutral	do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
48_ 0	neutral	i bought this as a gift for my sister .
48_ 1	negative	it has never worked .
48_ 2	negative	i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
48_ 3	neutral	i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
49_ 0	negative	purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
49_ 1	negative	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
49_ 2	neutral	the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
49_ 3	neutral	i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
49_ 4	neutral	i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .
49_ 5	negative	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
49_ 6	negative	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
49_ 7	neutral	i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
49_ 8	neutral	once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .
49_ 9	neutral	still no response .
49_ 10	neutral	i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
50_ 0	neutral	i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
50_ 1	negative	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
50_ 2	negative	now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
50_ 3	negative	have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
50_ 4	negative	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
50_ 5	negative	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
50_ 6	neutral	i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
51_ 0	neutral	i bought this product from amazon .
51_ 1	negative	after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
51_ 2	negative	i can only hear the sound but no picture !
51_ 3	negative	their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .
51_ 4	neutral	no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
52_ 0	neutral	i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
52_ 1	neutral	however , i should have followed my instincts :
52_ 2	neutral	you get what you pay for .
52_ 3	negative	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
52_ 4	negative	some dvd 's i rented would not play .
52_ 5	neutral	now , i suddenly have no picture .
52_ 6	neutral	i will say this .
52_ 7	negative	when the player was working it was great ,but .
53_ 0	neutral	the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
53_ 1	neutral	the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :
53_ 2	neutral	i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
53_ 3	neutral	i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
53_ 4	neutral	back to the 2600 :
53_ 5	neutral	1 .
53_ 6	positive	it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
53_ 7	neutral	2 .
53_ 8	positive	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
53_ 9	neutral	3 .
53_ 10	positive	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
53_ 11	neutral	4 .
53_ 12	positive	remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
53_ 13	neutral	anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
53_ 14	neutral	i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
53_ 15	neutral	with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
54_ 0	negative	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
54_ 1	positive	unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
54_ 2	positive	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
54_ 3	negative	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
54_ 4	negative	for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
54_ 5	negative	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well .
54_ 6	positive	this player seems to work fine with everything else .
54_ 7	neutral	so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
54_ 8	negative	because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
55_ 0	neutral	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
55_ 1	neutral	had no problem with it .
55_ 2	neutral	now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
55_ 3	neutral	so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
55_ 4	positive	it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
55_ 5	neutral	i have a dvd burner .
55_ 6	positive	apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
55_ 7	positive	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
55_ 8	neutral	some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
55_ 9	positive	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
55_ 10	neutral	if you are skeptical about trying apex .
55_ 11	neutral	take my words and give it a try .
55_ 12	neutral	hopefully you wo n't regret .
55_ 13	neutral	goodluck !
56_ 0	neutral	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
56_ 1	positive	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
56_ 2	positive	i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
56_ 3	positive	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
57_ 0	neutral	worked for two weeks .
57_ 1	negative	after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
57_ 2	neutral	spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
57_ 3	negative	apex sucks !
57_ 4	neutral	only the cheap and poor would buy one .
58_ 0	negative	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
59_ 0	neutral	i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
59_ 1	positive	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
59_ 2	positive	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
59_ 3	positive	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
59_ 4	positive	the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
59_ 5	neutral	again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
59_ 6	negative	the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
59_ 7	neutral	it 's not a big deal for me .
59_ 8	neutral	i simply watched the extra features on another player .
59_ 9	neutral	had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
59_ 10	neutral	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
59_ 11	positive	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
59_ 12	neutral	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
59_ 13	positive	i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
59_ 14	positive	there are a lot of things i like about it .
59_ 15	neutral	be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
60_ 0	positive	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
60_ 1	negative	the remote is a little hard to understand .
60_ 2	negative	my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor .
60_ 3	positive	so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
60_ 4	neutral	prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !
60_ 5	neutral	i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
61_ 0	negative	video output stopped workin .
61_ 1	negative	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
61_ 2	neutral	i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
61_ 3	neutral	i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
61_ 4	negative	what a disappointment !
62_ 0	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
62_ 1	neutral	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
62_ 2	negative	there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
62_ 3	negative	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
62_ 4	positive	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
62_ 5	neutral	perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy "" off "" brands .
63_ 0	neutral	i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
63_ 1	neutral	the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
63_ 2	neutral	now i may buy two !
63_ 3	neutral	( my orignal review is below : )
63_ 4	neutral	great feature list , poor reliability .
63_ 5	negative	output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
63_ 6	neutral	thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
64_ 0	positive	retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
64_ 1	positive	it works great .
64_ 2	neutral	i should have looked at it harder .
65_ 0	neutral	i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
65_ 1	neutral	so far we have only hooked up one of them .
65_ 2	positive	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" !
65_ 3	neutral	( i guess only time will tell ? )
65_ 4	negative	p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
66_ 0	negative	what the hell is wrong with this thing .
66_ 1	neutral	i bought this thing because it plays everything .
66_ 2	neutral	this is the third apex dvd i bought .
66_ 3	neutral	the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
66_ 4	neutral	the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
66_ 5	neutral	but heck it plays my alias dvds .
66_ 6	neutral	what the heck is up with the 2600 .
66_ 7	neutral	it suppose to play everything .
66_ 8	neutral	wrong !
66_ 9	neutral	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
66_ 10	neutral	i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
66_ 11	neutral	you should too .
66_ 12	negative	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
67_ 0	neutral	i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
67_ 1	negative	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
67_ 2	negative	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
68_ 0	neutral	we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .
68_ 1	negative	the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
68_ 2	neutral	the second one is up and running .
68_ 3	positive	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
68_ 4	neutral	i am returning the broken one today .
68_ 5	neutral	i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
68_ 6	negative	update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
69_ 0	positive	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
69_ 1	negative	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
69_ 2	neutral	after "" loading "" for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated "" no disk "" .
69_ 3	negative	after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
69_ 4	negative	only one disk played through to completion successfully .
69_ 5	neutral	at $ 49 .
69_ 6	neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
69_ 7	neutral	i 'd recommend against this unit .
70_ 0	neutral	i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
70_ 1	negative	when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
70_ 2	neutral	strike 1 .
70_ 3	negative	when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either !
70_ 4	negative	imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
70_ 5	negative	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
70_ 6	neutral	do not recommend .
71_ 0	neutral	what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
71_ 1	neutral	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
71_ 2	neutral	and have returned both .
71_ 3	negative	the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
71_ 4	neutral	my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .
71_ 5	neutral	i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
71_ 6	neutral	it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
71_ 7	positive	amazon is awaesome !
71_ 8	neutral	they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
71_ 9	neutral	what more could you ask for .
72_ 0	positive	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
72_ 1	negative	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
72_ 2	positive	it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
72_ 3	positive	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
72_ 4	neutral	recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
73_ 0	neutral	i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
73_ 1	neutral	i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .
73_ 2	positive	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
73_ 3	positive	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
73_ 4	positive	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
73_ 5	neutral	i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
73_ 6	neutral	even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
74_ 0	neutral	bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
74_ 1	neutral	that was a mistake .
74_ 2	negative	we tried the "" finding nemo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
74_ 3	neutral	cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
74_ 4	neutral	i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the "" finding nemo "" dvd works fine .
74_ 5	neutral	i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
74_ 6	negative	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
74_ 7	negative	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
75_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
75_ 1	neutral	i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .
75_ 2	negative	the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
75_ 3	neutral	it worked .
75_ 4	neutral	i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
75_ 5	neutral	the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .
75_ 6	neutral	the other company is currently "" out of stock "" so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
75_ 7	neutral	hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
75_ 8	neutral	if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
75_ 9	positive	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
75_ 10	positive	it plays everything , even vcd 's .
75_ 11	neutral	if only it played stand alone avi files .
75_ 12	neutral	if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .
75_ 13	neutral	if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
76_ 0	positive	i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of .
76_ 1	positive	but for what i do use it is perfect .
76_ 2	neutral	i was , however .
76_ 3	neutral	somewhat disappointed that i could not "" hook up "" to my sony multi brand remote commander .
76_ 4	neutral	small problem .
77_ 0	neutral	hi , many people are saying , "" you get what you pay for , i guess . ""
77_ 1	neutral	well that is not true .
77_ 2	neutral	you could have paid more and got a lot less .
77_ 3	neutral	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
77_ 4	neutral	you have to ask yourself , "" how much money is dissapointment worth ? ""
77_ 5	neutral	because , you will be dissapointed .
77_ 6	neutral	then you can say , "" my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . ""
77_ 7	neutral	i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !
77_ 8	neutral	so , without further adoo .
77_ 9	negative	1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! ""
77_ 10	negative	2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
77_ 11	neutral	3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
77_ 12	neutral	4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
77_ 13	negative	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
77_ 14	neutral	i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
77_ 15	neutral	you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
77_ 16	negative	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
77_ 17	neutral	and then you will start to belive them .
77_ 18	neutral	if this is your fist dvd player .
77_ 19	neutral	save yourself some aggrivation .
78_ 0	neutral	bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
78_ 1	negative	one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
78_ 2	positive	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
78_ 3	negative	apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
79_ 0	positive	the dvd player is fine .
79_ 1	neutral	to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press "" menu "" on the remote while the dvd is playing .
79_ 2	neutral	if the dvd is stopped , it will display "" playback only "" .
79_ 3	neutral	little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
80_ 0	neutral	i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
80_ 1	positive	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
80_ 2	positive	the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
80_ 3	negative	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
80_ 4	neutral	also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
80_ 5	positive	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
81_ 0	neutral	i bought this for my dad for christmas .
81_ 1	negative	when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
81_ 2	neutral	let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
81_ 3	neutral	as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
81_ 4	neutral	had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
81_ 5	neutral	save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
82_ 0	neutral	bought one for $ 49.99 .
82_ 1	negative	seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" .
82_ 2	neutral	sent mine back .
82_ 3	neutral	i 'd look elsewhere .
83_ 0	negative	granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
83_ 1	negative	first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
83_ 2	neutral	when i hit "" menu "" it told me , "" playback only . ""
83_ 3	neutral	i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
83_ 4	negative	this is extemely lame .
83_ 5	negative	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
83_ 6	negative	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
83_ 7	positive	the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
83_ 8	neutral	it also has an optical out , which it should .
83_ 9	neutral	i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
84_ 0	neutral	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
84_ 1	negative	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
84_ 2	negative	it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
84_ 3	negative	both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
84_ 4	negative	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
84_ 5	neutral	these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
84_ 6	negative	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
84_ 7	positive	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
84_ 8	negative	all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
85_ 0	negative	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
85_ 1	neutral	i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
86_ 0	positive	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
86_ 1	positive	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
86_ 2	negative	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
86_ 3	positive	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
86_ 4	neutral	so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
86_ 5	negative	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
86_ 6	neutral	ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
86_ 7	neutral	nothing !
86_ 8	negative	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
86_ 9	negative	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
86_ 10	neutral	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
86_ 11	neutral	upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
86_ 12	neutral	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
86_ 13	neutral	the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .
86_ 14	neutral	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
86_ 15	neutral	guess where this unit is headed ?
86_ 16	neutral	yup , right back for a refund !
87_ 0	neutral	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
87_ 1	neutral	i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
87_ 2	negative	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
87_ 3	negative	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
87_ 4	neutral	i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .
88_ 0	positive	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
88_ 1	neutral	the plus points are -
88_ 2	neutral	1 .
88_ 3	neutral	price
88_ 4	neutral	2 .
88_ 5	positive	ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
88_ 6	neutral	3 .
88_ 7	positive	good looks
88_ 8	neutral	the downside -
88_ 9	neutral	1 .
88_ 10	negative	the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
88_ 11	neutral	2 .
88_ 12	negative	remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
88_ 13	neutral	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
89_ 0	positive	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
89_ 1	positive	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
89_ 2	positive	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
89_ 3	positive	also , very light and portable .
90_ 0	negative	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
90_ 1	positive	it will read and play all cd audio disc .
90_ 2	neutral	guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .
90_ 3	neutral	so far not going to get a good review .
90_ 4	neutral	a disipointed customer .
91_ 0	positive	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
91_ 1	neutral	i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
91_ 2	neutral	that is where my satisfaction ends .
91_ 3	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .
91_ 4	negative	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
91_ 5	negative	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
91_ 6	negative	on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside .
91_ 7	neutral	after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
91_ 8	negative	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
91_ 9	neutral	i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
91_ 10	neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
92_ 0	negative	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
92_ 1	neutral	the case had ad2600 .
92_ 2	neutral	bait and switch .
92_ 3	neutral	picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
92_ 4	neutral	what is up .
92_ 5	neutral	clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
92_ 6	neutral	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
93_ 0	neutral	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
93_ 1	neutral	no go on most formats .
93_ 2	positive	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
93_ 3	negative	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
93_ 4	neutral	i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
93_ 5	positive	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
93_ 6	positive	good quality video .
94_ 0	neutral	bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .
94_ 1	negative	can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
94_ 2	positive	it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
94_ 3	neutral	i do n't have a dvd + r to try
94_ 4	neutral	so .
94_ 5	positive	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
95_ 0	positive	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
95_ 1	neutral	it goes nicely with my apex 27 "" in my bedroom .
95_ 2	positive	the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
95_ 3	neutral	i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
96_ 0	neutral	hooray !
96_ 1	neutral	think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
96_ 2	neutral	well , not with this one .
96_ 3	positive	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
96_ 4	positive	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
96_ 5	positive	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
96_ 6	positive	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
96_ 7	positive	so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
96_ 8	neutral	only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
96_ 9	neutral	otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
97_ 0	positive	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
97_ 1	positive	works great !
97_ 2	positive	silverish color really adds a special touch .
97_ 3	neutral	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
97_ 4	positive	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
97_ 5	neutral	if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !
97_ 6	neutral	apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .
97_ 7	neutral	if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
97_ 8	neutral	however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
97_ 9	positive	either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
98_ 0	positive	i am really impressed by this dvd player .
98_ 1	neutral	if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
98_ 2	positive	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
98_ 3	positive	no matter the format .
98_ 4	neutral	awesome !
99_ 0	positive	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
99_ 1	positive	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
99_ 2	neutral	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
99_ 3	neutral	i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
99_ 4	positive	they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
99_ 5	positive	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
99_ 6	positive	i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
99_ 7	neutral	ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
99_ 8	positive	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
99_ 9	positive	i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
99_ 10	neutral	great job canon !
100_ 0	neutral	yep .
100_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
100_ 2	neutral	i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
100_ 3	positive	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
100_ 4	positive	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
100_ 5	neutral	+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
100_ 6	neutral	as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
100_ 7	neutral	i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
100_ 8	neutral	a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
100_ 9	neutral	some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
100_ 10	negative	* main dial is not backlit .
100_ 11	negative	* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
100_ 12	neutral	( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
100_ 13	positive	overall i 'm happy with my toy .
101_ 0	neutral	i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
101_ 1	neutral	a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
101_ 2	neutral	following my research , i decided on the g3 .
101_ 3	positive	in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera .
101_ 4	positive	i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
101_ 5	positive	with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
101_ 6	neutral	and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
101_ 7	positive	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
101_ 8	neutral	do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
102_ 0	positive	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
102_ 1	positive	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
102_ 2	positive	the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
102_ 3	neutral	flaws ?
102_ 4	negative	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
102_ 5	neutral	still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
102_ 6	positive	despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
103_ 0	positive	i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
103_ 1	positive	the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
103_ 2	neutral	i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
103_ 3	neutral	i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
103_ 4	negative	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
103_ 5	neutral	i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
104_ 0	neutral	positives
104_ 1	positive	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .

1	neutral	They talked a bit about that (Iraq), and in the end President Obama asked President Bush how he was enjoying his new endeavor and whether they'd moved into the new house. So they talked a couple of minutes about that,
2	neutral	The new U.S. president, who came to office on the slogan of bringing change in the policies of the Bush administration, speaks of unconditional commitment to defend Israel's security,
3	negative	I view reversal of the Bush Administration's 2001 policy as an essential step to maximize the efficiency of bringing embryonic stem cell therapies to the clinic,
4	positive	We're invited to comment on the events of the day and along the way, we remind people that there was, indeed, good news under President Bush,
5	positive	We're invited to comment on the events of the day and along the way, we remind people that there was, indeed, good news under President Bush,
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
7	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
8	negative	If President Obama takes a look at what happened to President Bush, he won't want to,
9	negative	After the partisan and divisive approach that President Bush took with judicial nominations, I appreciate President Obama's seriousness in making his selection,
10	neutral	This is the PM who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto,
11	negative	President Bush has left President Obama a hard hand to play: an economy in crisis and a budget in deep deficit, in deficit this year alone by $1.752 trillion,
12	negative	No one should expect a lot of Bush nostalgia on this trip,
13	negative	Some of the policies followed by President Bush have given rise to a lot of anti-American feeling in Pakistan,
14	negative	All parts of the Labour party, from Tony Blair, the parliamentary Labour party, constituents and unions, agreed in 2004 that the Royal Mail would continue to belong to the people, and this pledge was included in the election manifesto ... in 2005.
15	positive	This was a great meeting where we discussed the key issues surrounding climate change policy with international leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who have already gained valuable insight on how such policies may affect manufacturing and economic opportunities,
16	negative	This confirms the widely held suspicions that leading officials and political advisers close to Tony Blair were deliberately tweaking the presentation of the intelligence to bolster the case for war on Iraq.
17	positive	I accept with pleasure the invitation from my friend Berlusconi... now that a spirit of friendship and cooperation prevails,
18	neutral	Chairman Kerry plans to hold a confirmation hearing for Assistant Secretary Hill as soon as possible, at which all views and concerns that senators may have can be aired,
19	neutral	When I came out of maternity leave, I met Nicolas Sarkozy and we talked about my future. He convinced me that political involvement exists in different forms,
20	neutral	It is now of course up to the French parliament to state its position, but the president (Sarkozy) has clearly indicated that the process that should lead France to resume its full place (in NATO) has reached its final stage,
21	neutral	Nicolas Sarkozy and (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel let it be known that France and Germany would not agree to Luxembourg, Austria or Belgium being put on a tax haven list,
22	positive	The secretary-general and Bill Clinton will bring a strong message of hope that Haiti is still winnable,
23	positive	Bill Clinton has a matchless talent for bringing people together and inspiring them to work for a higher purpose,
24	neutral	presents a critical assessment of Sen. Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Sen. Clinton,
25	neutral	The fact that Hillary presents a critical assessment of Senator Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton,
26	positive	This cohesion around the party of the majority, its chairman (Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev... this support is crucial today when the economic crisis is trying to grip Russia,
27	negative	Even in December [President Medvedev] said that Parliament was not working hard enough, that it was only undertaking 30% of the measures set down to tackle the financial crisis. He didn't name Vladimir Putin personally, of course, but still…
28	negative	Even in December [President Medvedev] said that Parliament was not working hard enough, that it was only undertaking 30% of the measures set down to tackle the financial crisis. He didn't name Vladimir Putin personally, of course, but still…
29	negative	As long as Putin and his people control the Kremlin, they'll do everything they can to keep Khodorkovsky in jail for as long as possible,
30	neutral	Because he was voted for as [Putin's] successor, he has to maintain a balance between continuity and his liberal initiatives,
31	neutral	Certainly, the crisis is a problem, but as Prime Minister Putin said, there will be no tragedy,
32	neutral	Former president Mbeki wishes to invite anyone who has such evidence to hand it over to the law enforcement agencies so that legal remedies are sought by any party that believes that it may have been unduly compromised,
33	negative	We are very disappointed with Osama bin Laden's call for fighting in Somalia when we already have a government,
34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.
36	neutral	It's time for Gordon Brown and his colleagues to break the spell Peter seems to have over the higher echelons of Government.
37	positive	These things are normally mostly ceremonial, but Brown's speech to Congress is the biggest single event of the trip,
38	positive	I'm deeply grateful to Her Majesty the Queen and to Prime Minister Brown for this extraordinary honor. I have always prized the opportunity to work with the British government and strengthen and deepen the role of our two countries as leading beacons of democracy in the world,
39	negative	Gordon Brown is deeply implicated in the mistakes of the past. Even if he won't apologise, he can't escape them.
40	negative	Gordon Brown seemed to offer a lot of warm words but very few hard plans to fight the recession which has engulfed the world economy and his government.
41	positive	It is right [of Mr Brown] to remind Americans that we need to work together against protectionism, in defeating terrorism and in combating climate change.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
45	negative	Gordon Brown's speech shows that he is in complete denial about how wrong he has been for 12 years, and his own responsibility for the banking crisis.
46	negative	Bin taxes are now dead in the water. 'This is a major snub for Gordon Brown and his ministers. These unpopular taxes would harm the environment by fuelling fly-tipping and backyard burning, and hike tax bills for struggling families.
47	negative	Last autumn Gordon Brown was boasting about how he masterminded the Lloyds takeover of HBOS and now he's saying it's got nothing to do with him. Macavity is back,
48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
49	negative	Central to Gordon Brown's attempt to draw a political dividing line with the Conservatives in the run up to the Budget, has been his claim that the whole world is signed up to yet more debt-funded fiscal stimulus.
50	neutral	I put the question of this famous black list to Gordon Brown, and he told me that he shared my concern and that everything had to be done to avoid such a situation,
51	negative	Gordon Brown should stop dithering and stop these plans in their tracks.
52	negative	Whilst taxpayers are shelling out for more jobs in the public sector, Gordon Brown is allowing companies to go to the wall,
53	positive	Gordon Brown's message that he wants to see the number of nuclear weapons reduced, that UK numbers are not fixed and that he is ready to work reduce them further, is a significant step towards a safer and eventually nuclear-weapon-free world,
54	negative	Gordon Brown is spending taxpayers' money on the latest digital gimmicks... but can't be bothered to give out a simple email address.
55	positive	I welcome that Gordon Brown reminded us of the
56	negative	When Gordon Brown sits down with the other G20 leaders in London next week, he will have to explain why he, of all the people sitting around the table, has the highest budget deficit.
57	negative	When it comes to plans for a second fiscal stimulus, I say this to Gordon Brown: enough is enough. We will not let you play roulette with the public finances yet again.
58	negative	One of the side-effects of quantitative easing will be a negative impact on pension funds and pensioners. Yet again pensioners are having to pay the price for Gordon Brown's age of irresponsibility.
59	negative	This is a direct result of Gordon Brown's reckless failure to provide enough prison places. Releasing criminals early has already resulted in three murders and over a thousand other crimes. It is unacceptable and Ministers must scrap this policy now.
60	neutral	Ask Mr Zapatero.
61	neutral	We are interested in continuity, stability and legitimacy in the period between the formal end of President Karzai's mandate on May 22 until August 20,
62	negative	There's a great concern about President Karzai,
63	positive	This is a magnificent result for Rajoy. It is going to shut up many (of his critics) and put wind in his sails,
64	negative	If the AK Party falls below 40 percent and loses Istanbul, this will be serious for Erdogan,
65	negative	If the AK Party falls below 40 percent and loses Istanbul, this will be serious for Erdogan,
66	positive	I want to thank His Excellency, the President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe,
67	negative	The message this sends out is that President Mugabe is still supportive of the criminal and lawless behaviour of his officials who want to loot and grab,
68	negative	No, we have given Mr. Mugabe enough time,
70	negative	Like Slobodan Milosevic or Charles Taylor, Omar al-Bashir's destiny is to face justice,
71	neutral	You know the secretary-general (Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) has said recently that Iran should be involved in a regional approach in regard of Afghanistan.
72	neutral	You know the secretary-general (Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) has said recently that Iran should be involved in a regional approach in regard of Afghanistan.
73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.

77	neutral	We are going ahead with the operations and we are on the right track, but it's not yet official that Beckham will stay at Milan,

80	neutral	I will discuss it with Mandela,
81	negative	The country wants to know from Prime Minster Manmohan Singh about this money that has simply vanished,
82	positive	I have the utmost respect for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. I have faith in Manmohan Singh and I have no problem in the alliance.
83	negative	Manmohan Singh is the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress. He is not the prime ministerial candidate of the UPA.
84	negative	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
86	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
87	negative	who could be weaker than Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister who could not even remove a senior Cabinet minister for not attending a single Cabinet meeting for one full year

91	neutral	I don't know if there will be more talks with Netanyahu or where they will lead,
92	positive	I have no doubt that with Netanyahu's government here we will have good and positive relations with the Obama administration,
93	neutral	This is a fundamental choice Bibi [Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu] must make - will he go with the Right, or with us? [A national unity government] should give an equal partnership and have diplomatic understandings, otherwise there will be no deal,
95	negative	I am not afraid of Binyamin Netanyahu,
97	negative	I am not afraid of Benjamin Netanyahu. I won't serve as a fig leaf to anyone, and I won't be anyone's dead weight. We will be the counter force that will prevent the formation of a narrow right wing government, and ensure the establishment of a real government that will take care of the Israeli people,
98	neutral	It would probably not be declared directly but Netanyahu's government will respect the idea of the two states,
99	negative	I'm delighted that the environment ministers have basically defied president Barroso and upheld the rights of individual countries to maintain their GMO bans,
100	positive	Through sheer force of will Thatcher carried along with her not only her own government, but that of the United States as well.
101	negative	who stands accused of walking straight into Margaret Thatcher's carefully laid trap. He walked in to an extent, at a speed, and with a lack of restraint that she could not, in her wildest dreams, have hoped for.

103	negative	Whilst in negotiations, Olmert and his government were busy drawing up plans for the devastating assault on Gaza, and approving the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements,
104	negative	We came here 10 days ago to be a reminder that this window is closing and to bring the matter to a public test. We hoped that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would take advantage of his last days in office to bring Gilad home. Unfortunately, we were wrong,
105	negative	It's been 1,000 days, in which Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who sent you on the mission [during which you were kidnapped], has not been able to find a way to bring you home. We are not even close to that day,
106	positive	Ultimately, history will judge Olmert's three-plus years as prime minister more favorably than is the accepted contemporary analysis,
107	positive	Our recent history in this country is we look for ‘hooks,' people who get you really fired up Ted Kennedy Newt Gingrich Hillary Clinton ,
108	negative	Before it's all over, it'll be called the Ted Kennedy Memorial Health Care bill ,
109	positive	I thought it would be appropriate to play tonight, because no one has done more than Senator Ted Kennedy to help resolve the problems of Ireland,
110	negative	It seemed in the past that the ODS was reluctant to name things with their real names. Only after they came to realise that Klaus has completely betrayed them they are starting doing so,
111	positive	Instead of there being a trial in Moscow of Khodorkovsky, there should be a hearing in Moscow to determine who has been behind the attack and destruction of Yukos,
112	negative	You simply cannot underestimate the importance of the Khodorkovsky case -- this process will show where Russia is going,
113	negative	The only difference between [Khodorkovsky] and any other large-scale business at the time was his anti-Kremlin stance,
114	negative	Lower-income people are very aware of the national debate, and are therefore pretty informed. This election is about whether you think Zuma is a hero or a villain,
115	positive	All these men, like Zuma incidentally, actually were comfortable in their own skin. They were people who knew themselves and their limitations and therefore they were able to make the right judgement calls,
116	neutral	He (Zuma) was very concerned about the situation,
117	negative	My daughter is 18 months old and if you asked me what will happen first -- will she get her pension or will Zuma be prosecuted -- I will say she will get her pension.
118	neutral	Thus, I write to you today to request the same opportunity to address the same congregation that Mr Zuma addressed,
119	neutral	I do not believe that the left has taken over. Those who think so, must look at the ANC statements and the statements of our likely president (Jacob Zuma) and find out if there is likeliness of moving to the left,
120	neutral	In the circumstances the DA requests you not to make any decision to discontinue Mr Zuma's prosecution until such time as it has made its representations,
121	negative	If this is indeed the basis of Zuma's representations, this actually aggravates the case against him,
122	negative	This hit on tax receipts is a real blow to Alastair Darling's budget hopes,
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
124	neutral	The decision was dictated by the Libyan guide (Gaddafi),
125	negative	If the Americans can apply pressure to guarantee compensation for victims, why is our own Government selling short victims from all corners of the United Kingdom who suffered at the hands of the terrorists Gaddafi bank-rolled, armed and trained?
128	negative	I am ready to welcome Tadic as president of Serbia if he agrees to come to the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo,
129	negative	I've never wanted to upset my friend Boris Tadic, but I wish he leaves the stadium upset and myself in high spirits,
132	negative	Mrs. Arroyo got personal with Cory,
133	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.

135	neutral	&gt;European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee has adopted by a large majority Jean-Luc Dehaene's Report analysing the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the power equilibrium within the European Union. J ean-Luc Dehaene MEP emphasises that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to important shifts in the competences of the various European institutions. In the future, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will be on the same footing as regards budgetary powers and legislative work, with c
136	positive	Ferrari was my university and Schumacher was my teacher,
138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,
139	negative	Peres established the reactor in Dimona and developed Israel's nuclear weapons program... In the same way as Pakistan's [nuclear scientist] Dr. Khan, Peres was the man behind the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Africa and other states. He was also behind the nuclear test in South America in 1978.
140	positive	I want to join with Peter. We need to pledge our support to Hugh Orde, to the police services North and South, in their work of combating the activities of these groups.
141	positive	We will leave no stone unturned in making sure that he [Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde] has available to him all the arrangements necessary to enhance security there.
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
143	neutral	Mervyn King [the Bank Governor] is obviously annoyed that Peter Mandelson is dragging the Bank of England into the argument he's having with Alistair Darling.
144	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
145	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
146	positive	He [Ferguson] has a very good organisation, he thinks one or two steps ahead, about what will happen next year or the year after,
147	neutral	he said. Both parties have maintained that they will not field candidates on strongholds. While the SP won't field candidates in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress will not contest in Mainpuri and Kannauj, the strongholds of Mulayam and son Akhilesh Yadav. SP has also expressed a desire to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi once again. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh told mediapersons in Lucknow that in case the two parties failed to reach an alliance his party was ready to contest
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
149	positive	For them (Third Front) being secular and communal is like changing clothes. A secular government without Sonia Gandhi is next to impossible. And this should not be considered as a sycophancy, it is a harsh fact in the country's politics,
150	neutral	I am ready for the talks (on seat-sharing) if Congress wants. Sonia Gandhi should take a decision in the interest of her party,
151	positive	he did not believe a dignified lady like Gandhi could have any role in the matter
152	neutral	The decision to purchase Cargill continues. We have received on behalf of its representatives the desire of collaborating no matter the decision of the Government and we will come to an agreement so as to continue with the compulsory purchase process announced by the President of the Republic, Hugo Chavez,
153	neutral	I think this a reaction to what happened in the elections last year. Even though Chavez's party did well, it lost the big states,
154	neutral	Michael Jackson phoned her over the weekend but couldn't get through. He wanted to pop in and see her but instead sent her his love and said he was thinking about her.
155	neutral	Eventually he settled on the summer and agreed to work around any shows already booked. Michael Jackson might be the biggest pop star in the world - and these shows are the hottest ticket in town - but not even he can override pre-existing contracts.
156	neutral	Can you believe I got a message from Michael Jackson?

160	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
161	neutral	I think that Hillary Clinton, when she comes today, will find Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to continue to hold negotiations, not only on economic projects but also political negotiations, a political process,
162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end ‘dialogue of the deaf,'
163	neutral	That is the proposition of the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,
164	neutral	presents a critical assessment of Sen. Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Sen. Clinton,
165	neutral	Mrs Clinton's response was very positive,
166	positive	And some of those who played a central role in our peace process are with us today, including your secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and, of course, our dear friend, Senator George Mitchell,
167	negative	Mr. Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second when it opens at the beginning of the next legislative term,
168	neutral	There is no reason to treat Le Pen differently from others, even if we hate his politics.
169	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution,
170	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second,
171	neutral	Every day we receive various information about Ratko Mladic and once we gather enough information we will arrest him,
172	neutral	I've had a substantial discussion with Sergey Lavrov, we ran an ective evaluation of our bilateral ties and agreed on the measures that need to be taken to move on to a new stage in our relationship,

179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.
180	neutral	At the moment, Merkel has had no recipe for rescuing her party and attracting new voters,
181	neutral	The President had very productive video conferences this week and phone calls with (Germany's) Chancellor Merkel, with (Britain's) Prime Minister Brown, and (France's) President Sarkozy,
182	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,
183	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,
184	neutral	It will be an interesting match against Roddick,
185	positive	John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national greatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and strength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our

187	neutral	After Netanyahu and Lieberman settled the future government's guidelines for regional talks, which focus on toppling Hamas' regime and refusing to commit Israel to a two-state solution, Labor has no reason to stay on,
188	negative	This is a personal-political matter on Lieberman's part. He is leading this proposal only to enable the 200,000 Russians who immigrated to Israel and then emigrated to take part in elections and get their vote at the polling station.
189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked. Do you support or oppose these positions?
190	negative	Zardari has given us the go-ahead to talk to Nawaz Sharif, which is a good sign,
191	neutral	The ambassador was trying to get things resolved between Mr Sharif and the government,
193	neutral	I am sure we can work with Nawaz Sharif in strengthening the democratic process,
194	neutral	I came to meet Mr Nawaz Sharif with an olive branch from the government, with a message from President Asif Ali Zardari that the situation demands greater reconciliation because Pakistan faces great challenges,
195	positive	I don't have the slightest doubt that it was Gorbachev and his policy of glasnost and perestroika that opened the gates for the great changes that first took place in our country and then in this part of the continent,
196	neutral	after the results of local council elections in Iraq and the analysis of these results, it was normal to visit Iraq to convey a message from President al-Assad to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Premier Nouri al-Maliki to congratulate the Iraqi people over the results of these elections and to reiterate keenness on the unity and independence of Iraq. He added that what has been said about the concern for unity and independence of Iraq, the constitutional review and national reconciliation, in addition to
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
199	positive	Even though Pak Lah (Badawi) will soon leave the government and I will leave it too, someday, I believe this spirit of togetherness and the partnership that we've built will continue to expand in the future,
200	neutral	I'm sure you know that the congressional purchase of offsets that Speaker Pelosi initiated several years ago has been suspended for the very reason that they can't guarantee that the offsets are really what they appear to be,
201	neutral	Our leader, Nancy Pelosi, has called for us to examine whether there should be a second stimulus package,
202	neutral	President Chissano has briefed us that he is prepared to talk to Kony,
203	neutral	Nothing has changed from what was agreed in Juba. Chissano has briefed us that he would talk to Kony and find it out from him what has changed,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab
205	negative	There have been rumours of a secret Heathrow deal between the Government and BAA, and these revelations will only add to people's justifiable suspicions. 'The questions now are, what did Mandelson and his friend Rudd discuss, were minutes taken, who offered what to whom and what was agreed? The same questions need to be answered about the meetings between Rudd and Lord Adonis.
206	negative	We take note, with concern, of the views and comments of Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.
207	neutral	Russia is interested in this initiative undertaken by Kevin Rudd about setting up the Asia Pacific Community,
208	negative	I am the victim of a lynching organized by the judicial counselor of the government, [Menahem] Mazuz, the police, politicians and the media,
210	neutral	My dream was to get David Coulthard back on the map where he belonged and in some ways I think we all managed that.
211	neutral	I've already tried David Coulthard and another friend with no response and then realised I should ask you.
212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
213	positive	We are commending Sen. Specter for putting American jobs first and opposing card check legislation,
214	neutral	I have heard the rumours about Wenger leaving for the past three years,
215	neutral	People should not read this as a snub. He (Tsvangirai) excused himself,
216	neutral	I was present when Prime Minister Tsvangirai gave the number (US$5 billion), but it was just a number given. There's a document that actually splits the immediate costs over the next 10 months into two amounts of about a billion dollars each,
217	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
218	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
219	positive	I am very sorry for Tsvangirai and his family,
220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
221	neutral	I don't have a comment. If they (Tsvangirai and the Ministers of Home Affairs) have spoken at that level I can't comment,
222	neutral	Gagnon said. President José Eduardo dos Santos, in power for 30 years, had announced presidential elections for 2009. However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament. Uncertainty over whether presidential elections will take place in 2009 is not an excuse for letting the problems highlighted by last year's elections go unremedied ,
223	neutral	We cannot understand the timing of this decision. While we are trying to extinguish the fire here with our troops they chose this exact moment to put more oil on the flames by taking a decision to issue an arrest warrant for President Al-Bashir,
224	negative	The law is clear. President al Bashir must appear before the ICC to defend himself. If he refuses to do so, the Sudanese authorities must ensure that he is arrested and surrendered immediately to the ICC,
225	negative	Today's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir is a landmark step towards ending the impunity of war crimes suspects everywhere. It shows that no-one even a sitting head of state is above international law,
226	positive	The indictment of President Al-Bashir is disastrous for all of us Sudanese, government and opposition. It is totally unacceptable and regrettable,
227	neutral	When the issue came up, we said we cannot condemn Gen. Bashir out of hand and we cannot condone what he is alleged to have done. We decided the best thing was to send our own high level team to do the investigations. That is what we are doing,
228	neutral	No one is above the law. If you are charged with a crime, you must stand up and face those charges in a court of law. President Al-Bashir will have the opportunity to do this before the International Criminal Court,
229	neutral	I don't want to condemn Gen. Bashir nor condone impunity. It will be constructive to defer or suspend the ICC indictments on Gen Bashir,
230	neutral	We are closely watching the regional moves, but holding Al-Bashir accountable in The Hague is not negotiable.
231	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
232	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
233	neutral	Sudan is facing a new ring of conspiracy and a flagrant violation of Sudan's sovereignty and blatant intervention in its internal affairs by the warrant against President Omar al-Bashir
234	neutral	There is a clear Arab and African stance that does not accept the way the ICC has handled the issue of President Al-Bashir,
235	negative	The minister of defense (Barak) changes his opinion and positions according to his mood. After he previously said that he would respond to any rocket attacks, he changed his mind following operation cast lead and declined to respond to the Strip's rockets,
236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
237	neutral	It is completely natural for Barak to want to join the Bibi-Lieberman government,
238	positive	They have genuine world-class players and where once they relied on Steven Gerrard there's now Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher. When they beat us at Anfield earlier this season Gerrard and Torres weren't even playing.
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.
240	negative	We have a video footage showing how GERB activists are giving out food products to voters, and a mass fight which breaks out after there are not enough products for everyone. I am going to send this footage together with a martenitsa to Wilfried Martens (the President of the European People's Party of which GERB is a member), who recently declared his support for GERB, in order to show him how they do elections in Bulgaria
241	neutral	I remain gravely concerned about Gaza, and about where we stand in the search for an independent Palestinian State. The people of Gaza are suffering, and the situation at the crossings is intolerable. The way forward is a durable ceasefire, open crossings, and Palestinian reconciliation under President Abbas,
242	neutral	on Turkey becoming an EU member. Brothers and sisters, Bulgarians! What would Turkey's EU membership mean for Europe? I will tell you with facts and numbers. Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.

V aldis Dombrovskis has undertaken the challenging task of heading the government at one of the most difficult times when many countries in Europe and elsewhere, Latvia included, are facing new challenges on how to find effective solutions and make difficult decisions to overcome the current economic crisis. I am sure that in his new positio
245	neutral	In 12 weeks' time, the people of Galway, along with people from Malin Head to the Shannon estuary, will cast their ballots to choose the people who will represent them in the European Parliament for the next five years.
246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.
250	neutral	The Ministry of External Affairs is going to take up with the US State Department the issue with the aim of stalling the auction,
252	neutral	has revealed the core challenge to the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole in the next century: to forge unity behind the principle that massive and systematic violations of human rights - wherever they may take place - should not be allowed to stand.
253	neutral	The Security Council should condemn the fact that an indicted war criminal has deliberately put yet more lives at risk by expelling aid workers,
254	neutral	We've sanctioned low-level contacts with them so that we can make absolutely clear our determination to see UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the disbanding of militias among other things in Lebanon, taken forward with real speed,
255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
256	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,
257	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,

260	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,

264	neutral	We are about to set up a high-level delegation to go to New York to lobby the UN Security Council,
