DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)
DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
DVDS_35_4	negative	Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.
DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
DVDS_36_16	negative	Then there is Vin Diesel. I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
DVDS_36_23	negative	Stay away from this film like the plague.
DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.
DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
DVDS_37_4	negative	It never came.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
DVDS_38_2	neutral	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.
DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
DVDS_38_6	negative	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.
DVDS_38_12	negative	She was actually doing a ""chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide"" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.
DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
DVDS_38_18	negative	Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""
DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
DVDS_38_32	negative	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
DVDS_38_34	negative	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
DVDS_38_35	neutral	The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with ""pretties"".
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
DVDS_38_38	negative	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
DVDS_38_42	negative	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
DVDS_38_44	negative	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all.
DVDS_39_2	negative	However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
DVDS_39_7	positive	Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.
DVDS_39_8	neutral	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film's end.
DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
DVDS_40_1	neutral	The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.
DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.
DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
DVDS_40_7	neutral	While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear.
DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
DVDS_41_13	neutral	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.
DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
DVDS_43_2	negative	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
DVDS_43_10	negative	WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old ""Twilight Zone""'s, ""POLTERGEIST"", 'THE CHANGELING"", ""AUDREY ROSE"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and ""THE RING"" to name several off the top of my head.
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
DVDS_45_5	negative	But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?
DVDS_45_6	negative	They should have just re-released the original.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
DVDS_48_3	negative	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
DVDS_49_4	positive	Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering â€“ loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).
DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
DVDS_49_8	positive	Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.
DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
DVDS_50_6	positive	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
DVDS_52_1	neutral	(Dir: Susannah Grant) Jennifer is a great ""catch"" and the film isn't half bad either.
DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
DVDS_52_12	positive	There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!)
DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
DVDS_52_17	positive	There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).
DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.
DVDS_52_19	positive	The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
DVDS_53_13	positive	Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
DVDS_54_3	positive	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.
DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
DVDS_55_9	positive	The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
DVDS_56_9	positive	Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane â€“ keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.
ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.
ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
ELECTRONICS_58_7	negative	I only had a short time to use the unit.
ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
ELECTRONICS_59_1	negative	I really wish I hadn't.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
ELECTRONICS_60_10	negative	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
ELECTRONICS_61_6	negative	I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
ELECTRONICS_65_3	neutral	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.
ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
ELECTRONICS_69_2	negative	Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...
ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
ELECTRONICS_70_5	neutral	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
ELECTRONICS_71_4	neutral	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.
ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
ELECTRONICS_71_6	negative	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
ELECTRONICS_71_12	negative	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
ELECTRONICS_72_8	negative	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
ELECTRONICS_72_10	negative	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.
BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
BOOKS_1_2	negative	The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.
BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
BOOKS_1_5	neutral	For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.
BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
BOOKS_2_2	negative	It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
BOOKS_2_6	neutral	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.
BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
BOOKS_3_6	negative	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
BOOKS_4_7	negative	Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned.
BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
BOOKS_5_3	negative	However, today, 60 years after it was first published , ""How to read a Book"" doesn't impress as much.
BOOKS_5_5	negative	This is not the book for your goal.
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
BOOKS_5_15	positive	CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading.
BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
BOOKS_6_5	negative	This does not happen.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
BOOKS_7_0	negative	First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.
BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
BOOKS_7_17	negative	Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
BOOKS_7_19	negative	;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!
BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.
BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
BOOKS_9_6	negative	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.
BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
BOOKS_10_7	negative	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.
BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
BOOKS_11_5	positive	I was really enjoying that style of writing.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.
BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.
BOOKS_13_1	negative	Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?
BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?
BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
BOOKS_13_6	positive	I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.
BOOKS_13_7	negative	I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
BOOKS_14_2	neutral	I could relate with Pi on his views about God and religion.
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
BOOKS_14_6	positive	But in the end it all came together.
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
BOOKS_16_6	positive	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
BOOKS_18_16	positive	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
BOOKS_22_0	positive	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
BOOKS_22_3	positive	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
BOOKS_22_4	positive	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.
BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
DVDS_30_3	negative	Just plain sucks.
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
DVDS_31_1	negative	Robert Rodriguez camera angles, ""Matrix"" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal ""DeadAlive"" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.
DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
DVDS_32_0	negative	SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.
DVDS_32_1	negative	The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).
DVDS_32_3	negative	Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
DVDS_32_7	negative	The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
DVDS_32_9	negative	That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.
DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
DVDS_33_3	negative	The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy â€“ cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned â€“ although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
