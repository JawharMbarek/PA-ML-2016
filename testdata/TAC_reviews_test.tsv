MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommendedMUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.MUSIC_264_5	positive	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.VIDEOGAMES_271_10	negative	Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.VIDEOGAMES_271_13	negative	Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.VIDEOGAMES_282_10	positive	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genreVIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)VIDEOGAMES_287_1	positive	Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
