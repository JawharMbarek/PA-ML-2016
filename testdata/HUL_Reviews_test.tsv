247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .254_ 3	neutral	i took the camera and just gave it to someone .254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .254_ 8	neutral	my pda becames a digital album .254_ 9	neutral	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .254_ 11	neutral	go get it .254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .258_ 12	neutral	i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason :258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .260_ 7	neutral	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .262_ 16	positive	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .263_ 0	positive	great camera .263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .263_ 2	positive	it takes great pictures .263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !265_ 13	neutral	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !268_ 0	positive	seriously ! i love it !268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :270_ 2	positive	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .270_ 9	positive	8 battery life is excellent .270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .270_ 20	neutral	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?274_ 16	negative	the volume .274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .274_ 23	negative	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .274_ 24	neutral	reason ?274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .274_ 29	neutral	24 hours ?274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .274_ 39	neutral	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .278_ 1	positive	it is small .278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .280_ 0	neutral	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .282_ 9	neutral	the radio :282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .282_ 29	neutral	battery life :282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :283_ 1	neutral	pros :283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .283_ 6	neutral	cons :283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .284_ 1	neutral	great features . .284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...285_ 22	neutral	pros :285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life285_ 31	neutral	cons :285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff

3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from

conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .289_ 2	neutral	pros :289_ 3	positive	small size .289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .289_ 11	neutral	cons :289_ 12	neutral	not many .289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?289_ 15	neutral	please !289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .290_ 8	neutral	overall design :290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .290_ 19	neutral	battery :290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .290_ 22	neutral	features :290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .290_ 36	neutral	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .294_ 8	neutral	thanks !295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .297_ 4	negative	its quiet .297_ 5	neutral	really quiet .297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .297_ 7	neutral	i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .299_ 3	neutral	you do take your chances with this phone .300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .300_ 17	neutral	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .301_ 18	neutral	go for it !302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...302_ 3	neutral	almost there .302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .302_ 14	positive	great features .. .303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .305_ 6	neutral	now i can always be in contact .305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?308_ 5	neutral	...309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .310_ 21	neutral	their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
