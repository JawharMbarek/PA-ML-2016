BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.BOOKS_1_2	negative	The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.BOOKS_1_5	neutral	For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.BOOKS_2_2	negative	It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.BOOKS_2_6	neutral	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.BOOKS_3_6	negative	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.BOOKS_4_7	negative	Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned.BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!BOOKS_5_3	negative	However, today, 60 years after it was first published , ""How to read a Book"" doesn't impress as much.BOOKS_5_5	negative	This is not the book for your goal.BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!BOOKS_5_15	positive	CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading.BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.BOOKS_6_5	negative	This does not happen.BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!BOOKS_7_0	negative	First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?BOOKS_7_17	negative	Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.BOOKS_7_19	negative	;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.BOOKS_9_6	negative	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.BOOKS_10_7	negative	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.BOOKS_11_5	positive	I was really enjoying that style of writing.BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.BOOKS_13_1	negative	Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.BOOKS_13_6	positive	I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.BOOKS_13_7	negative	I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.BOOKS_14_2	neutral	I could relate with Pi on his views about God and religion.BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.BOOKS_14_6	positive	But in the end it all came together.BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.BOOKS_16_6	positive	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.BOOKS_18_16	positive	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!BOOKS_22_0	positive	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.BOOKS_22_3	positive	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.BOOKS_22_4	positive	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.DVDS_30_3	negative	Just plain sucks.DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!DVDS_31_1	negative	Robert Rodriguez camera angles, ""Matrix"" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal ""DeadAlive"" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!DVDS_32_0	negative	SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.DVDS_32_1	negative	The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).DVDS_32_3	negative	Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.DVDS_32_7	negative	The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.DVDS_32_9	negative	That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.DVDS_33_3	negative	The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy â€“ cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned â€“ although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.DVDS_35_4	negative	Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?DVDS_36_16	negative	Then there is Vin Diesel. I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!DVDS_36_23	negative	Stay away from this film like the plague.DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.DVDS_37_4	negative	It never came.DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?DVDS_38_2	neutral	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.DVDS_38_6	negative	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.DVDS_38_12	negative	She was actually doing a ""chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide"" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.DVDS_38_18	negative	Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.DVDS_38_32	negative	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.DVDS_38_34	negative	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.DVDS_38_35	neutral	The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with ""pretties"".DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.DVDS_38_38	negative	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.DVDS_38_42	negative	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.DVDS_38_44	negative	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all.DVDS_39_2	negative	However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.DVDS_39_7	positive	Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.DVDS_39_8	neutral	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film's end.DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.DVDS_40_1	neutral	The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).DVDS_40_7	neutral	While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear.DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)DVDS_41_13	neutral	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.DVDS_43_2	negative	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).DVDS_43_10	negative	WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old ""Twilight Zone""'s, ""POLTERGEIST"", 'THE CHANGELING"", ""AUDREY ROSE"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and ""THE RING"" to name several off the top of my head.DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.DVDS_45_5	negative	But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?DVDS_45_6	negative	They should have just re-released the original.DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.DVDS_48_3	negative	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).DVDS_49_4	positive	Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering â€“ loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.DVDS_49_8	positive	Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.DVDS_50_6	positive	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.DVDS_52_1	neutral	(Dir: Susannah Grant) Jennifer is a great ""catch"" and the film isn't half bad either.DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.DVDS_52_12	positive	There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!)DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).DVDS_52_17	positive	There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.DVDS_52_19	positive	The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.DVDS_53_13	positive	Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.DVDS_54_3	positive	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.DVDS_55_9	positive	The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.DVDS_56_9	positive	Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane â€“ keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.ELECTRONICS_58_7	negative	I only had a short time to use the unit.ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.ELECTRONICS_59_1	negative	I really wish I hadn't.ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.ELECTRONICS_60_10	negative	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.ELECTRONICS_61_6	negative	I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.ELECTRONICS_65_3	neutral	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.ELECTRONICS_69_2	negative	Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.ELECTRONICS_70_5	neutral	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.ELECTRONICS_71_4	neutral	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.ELECTRONICS_71_6	negative	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.ELECTRONICS_71_12	negative	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.ELECTRONICS_72_8	negative	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!ELECTRONICS_72_10	negative	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.ELECTRONICS_73_0	neutral	Pros: Many features, rapid rewind/fast-forward on VCR. ... Cons: Remote control somewhat difficult to learn to use, Sony service and exchange policies awful.ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.ELECTRONICS_73_16	negative	I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.ELECTRONICS_79_1	positive	Looks good.ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.MUSIC_86_12	negative	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVDMUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good moneyMUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...MUSIC_94_10	positive	has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered...MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.MUSIC_95_1	negative	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.MUSIC_95_8	negative	Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.MUSIC_98_5	negative	Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.MUSIC_107_3	positive	her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......VIDEOGAMES_127_30	negative	Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.VIDEOGAMES_129_0	positive	I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeperVIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.VIDEOGAMES_134_35	negative	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.VIDEOGAMES_134_81	negative	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.VIDEOGAMES_135_3	positive	It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fanVIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.VIDEOGAMES_143_11	positive	Bottom line love Star wars get it.VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.DVDS_176_3	negative	I was extremely disappointed.DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. RailroadjamesDVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...DVDS_187_4	negative	The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?DVDS_191_28	negative	This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.DVDS_194_7	neutral	Let's! Acting from Michael Chiklis (not anymore) was OK. I just didn't get into his character the thing.DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.ELECTRONICS_209_1	negative	It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.ELECTRONICS_209_2	negative	My T720 has broke down several times.ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another motoELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.ELECTRONICS_220_2	neutral	Maybe I've not set it up correctly.ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup softwareELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.ELECTRONICS_227_6	positive	Truly fantastic pictures.ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
